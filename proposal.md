Abstract:

The output of the project will be a model which will allow to reduce the style in which the text of interest is written. Further it will be possible to apply a specific writing style (e.g. Pushkin style, 50cent style) to any the text snippet.
The practical use case of the project can be search of the possible author of the phrase, paragraph, sentance, etc...
The fun side of the project will allow users to mimic famous authors in their messaging, essays, etc...

Impact:
There are a lot of applications which allow to find music authors with a small part of a melody from that music. It is obvious that this kind of applications were very popular and hance are useful. At the same time not much isdone in the tect processing direction.
