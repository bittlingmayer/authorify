__label__di Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine o’clock one morning, a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching the latter city at full speed. The morning was so damp and misty that it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking; and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage windows.
__label__di Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at the different stations nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside.
__label__di When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages found themselves opposite each other. Both were young fellows, both were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation. If they had but known why, at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw Railway Company.
__label__di One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes. His nose was broad and flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent, ironical--it might almost be called a malicious--smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen, self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large fur--or rather astrachan--overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared. His wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it--the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North Italy--was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.
__label__di The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very fair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence, of an epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. He held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very un-Russian.
__label__di His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having nothing better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:
__label__di “Cold?”
__label__di “Very,” said his neighbour, readily, “and this is a thaw, too. Fancy if it had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the old country. I’ve grown quite out of the way of it.”
__label__di “What, been abroad, I suppose?”
__label__di “Yes, straight from Switzerland.”
__label__di “Wheugh! my goodness!” The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then laughed.
__label__di The conversation proceeded. The readiness of the fair-haired young man in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour’s questions was surprising. He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him. Replying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had been long absent from Russia, more than four years; that he had been sent abroad for his health; that he had suffered from some strange nervous malady--a kind of epilepsy, with convulsive spasms. His interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and more than ever, when to the question, “whether he had been cured?” the patient replied:
__label__di “No, they did not cure me.”
__label__di “Hey! that’s it! You stumped up your money for nothing, and we believe in those fellows, here!” remarked the black-haired individual, sarcastically.
__label__di “Gospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!” exclaimed another passenger, a shabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face. “Gospel truth! All they do is to get hold of our good Russian money free, gratis, and for nothing.”
__label__di “Oh, but you’re quite wrong in my particular instance,” said the Swiss patient, quietly. “Of course I can’t argue the matter, because I know only my own case; but my doctor gave me money--and he had very little--to pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while there, for nearly two years.”
__label__di “Why? Was there no one else to pay for you?” asked the black-haired one.
__label__di “No--Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple of years ago. I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a distant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter. And so eventually I came back.”
__label__di “And where have you come to?”
__label__di “That is--where am I going to stay? I--I really don’t quite know yet, I--”
__label__di Both the listeners laughed again.
__label__di “I suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?” asked the first.
__label__di “I bet anything it is!” exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with extreme satisfaction, “and that he has precious little in the luggage van!--though of course poverty is no crime--we must remember that!”
__label__di It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. The young fellow hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness.
__label__di “Your bundle has some importance, however,” continued the clerk, when they had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of their mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); “for though I dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d’or and louis d’or--judge from your costume and gaiters--still--if you can add to your possessions such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General Epanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. That is, of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchin’s, and have not made a little error through--well, absence of mind, which is very common to human beings; or, say--through a too luxuriant fancy?”
__label__di “Oh, you are right again,” said the fair-haired traveller, “for I really am _almost_ wrong when I say she and I are related. She is hardly a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter. I expected as much.”
__label__di “H’m! you spent your postage for nothing, then. H’m! you are candid, however--and that is commendable. H’m! Mrs. Epanchin--oh yes! a most eminent person. I know her. As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in Switzerland, I know him too--at least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch of that name? A fine fellow he was--and had a property of four thousand souls in his day.”
__label__di “Yes, Nicolai Andreevitch--that was his name,” and the young fellow looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with the red nose.
__label__di This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class. They are people who know everyone--that is, they know where a man is employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what money his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc. These men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and they spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of knowledge, which they reduce--or raise--to the standard of a science.
__label__di During the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man had become very impatient. He stared out of the window, and fidgeted, and evidently longed for the end of the journey. He was very absent; he would appear to listen--and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a sudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.
__label__di “Excuse me,” said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle, rather suddenly; “whom have I the honour to be talking to?”
__label__di “Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,” replied the latter, with perfect readiness.
__label__di “Prince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? H’m! I don’t know, I’m sure! I may say I have never heard of such a person,” said the clerk, thoughtfully. “At least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the family name, of course, in his history--but as an individual--one never hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.”
__label__di “Of course not,” replied the prince; “there are none, except myself. I believe I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have always been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army. I don’t know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she is descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her line.”
__label__di “And did you learn science and all that, with your professor over there?” asked the black-haired passenger.
__label__di “Oh yes--I did learn a little, but--”
__label__di “I’ve never learned anything whatever,” said the other.
__label__di “Oh, but I learned very little, you know!” added the prince, as though excusing himself. “They could not teach me very much on account of my illness.”
__label__di “Do you know the Rogojins?” asked his questioner, abruptly.
__label__di “No, I don’t--not at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia. Why, is that your name?”
__label__di “Yes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.”
__label__di “Parfen Rogojin? dear me--then don’t you belong to those very Rogojins, perhaps--” began the clerk, with a very perceptible increase of civility in his tone.
__label__di “Yes--those very ones,” interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with scant courtesy. I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the blotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks direct to the prince.
__label__di “Dear me--is it possible?” observed the clerk, while his face assumed an expression of great deference and servility--if not of absolute alarm: “what, a son of that very Semen Rogojin--hereditary honourable citizen--who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of roubles?”
__label__di “And how do _you_ know that he left two million and a half of roubles?”  asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and not deigning so much as to look at the other. “However, it’s true enough that my father died a month ago, and that here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot to my foot. They’ve treated me like a dog! I’ve been ill of fever at Pskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I received from my mother or my confounded brother!”
__label__di “And now you’ll have a million roubles, at least--goodness gracious me!”  exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.
__label__di “Five weeks since, I was just like yourself,” continued Rogojin, addressing the prince, “with nothing but a bundle and the clothes I wore. I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my aunt’s house, where I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was away. All honour to my respected father’s memory--but he uncommonly nearly killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadn’t cut and run then, when I did, he’d have murdered me like a dog.”
__label__di “I suppose you angered him somehow?” asked the prince, looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity. But though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that. Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as safety-valve to his agitation.
__label__di As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latter--since the information as to the identity of Rogojin--hung over him, seemed to be living on the honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every syllable as though it were a pearl of great price.
__label__di “Oh, yes; I angered him--I certainly did anger him,” replied Rogojin. “But what puts me out so is my brother. Of course my mother couldn’t do anything--she’s too old--and whatever brother Senka says is law for her! But why couldn’t he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say. What’s the good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it back to the office unopened, and there it’s been ever since! It’s only thanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it. He says my brother cut off the gold tassels from my father’s coffin, at night ‘because they’re worth a lot of money!’ says he. Why, I can get him sent off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; it’s sacrilege. Here, you--scarecrow!” he added, addressing the clerk at his side, “is it sacrilege or not, by law?”
__label__di “Sacrilege, certainly--certainly sacrilege,” said the latter.
__label__di “And it’s Siberia for sacrilege, isn’t it?”
__label__di “Undoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!”
__label__di “They will think that I’m still ill,” continued Rogojin to the prince, “but I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came away. Aha, brother Senka, you’ll have to open your gates and let me in, my boy! I know he told tales about me to my father--I know that well enough but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna that’s very sure, and that was my own doing.”
__label__di “Nastasia Philipovna?” said the clerk, as though trying to think out something.
__label__di “Come, you know nothing about _her_,” said Rogojin, impatiently.
__label__di “And supposing I do know something?” observed the other, triumphantly.
__label__di “Bosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas. And what an impertinent beast you are!” he added angrily. “I thought some creature like you would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money.”
__label__di “Oh, but I do know, as it happens,” said the clerk in an aggravating manner. “Lebedeff knows all about her. You are pleased to reproach me, your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all? Nastasia Phillpovna’s family name is Barashkoff--I know, you see--and she is a very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too. She is connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable property, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of General Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is.”
__label__di “My eyes!” said Rogojin, really surprised at last. “The devil take the fellow, how does he know that?”
__label__di “Why, he knows everything--Lebedeff knows everything! I was a month or two with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he was knocking about--he’s in the debtor’s prison now--I was with him, and he couldn’t do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia Philipovna and several people at that time.”
__label__di “Nastasia Philipovna? Why, you don’t mean to say that she and Lihachof--” cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.
__label__di “No, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!” said Lebedeff, hastily. “Oh dear no, not for the world! Totski’s the only man with any chance there. Oh, no! He takes her to his box at the opera at the French theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at her and say, ‘By Jove, there’s the famous Nastasia Philipovna!’ but no one ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.”
__label__di “Yes, it’s quite true,” said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; “so Zaleshoff told me. I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my father’s old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped into her carriage. I swear I was all of a blaze at once. Then I met Zaleshoff--looking like a hair-dresser’s assistant, got up as fine as I don’t know who, while I looked like a tinker. ‘Don’t flatter yourself, my boy,’ said he; ‘she’s not for such as you; she’s a princess, she is, and her name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with Totski, who wishes to get rid of her because he’s growing rather old--fifty-five or so--and wants to marry a certain beauty, the loveliest woman in all Petersburg.’ And then he told me that I could see Nastasia Philipovna at the opera-house that evening, if I liked, and described which was her box. Well, I’d like to see my father allowing any of us to go to the theatre; he’d sooner have killed us, any day. However, I went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and I never slept a wink all night after. Next morning my father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand roubles each. ‘Sell them,’ said he, ‘and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.’ Well, I sold the bonds, but I didn’t take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went straight to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond the size of a nut in each. They cost four hundred roubles more than I had, so I gave my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at once to Zaleshoff’s. ‘Come on!’ I said, ‘come on to Nastasia Philipovna’s,’ and off we went without more ado. I tell you I hadn’t a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way; I saw nothing whatever. We went straight into her drawing-room, and then she came out to us.
__label__di “I didn’t say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: ‘From Parfen Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind as to accept these!’
__label__di “She opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed.
__label__di “‘Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,’ says she, and bowed and went off. Why didn’t I die there on the spot? The worst of it all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I was short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and never said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all in the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing and scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!
__label__di “‘Look here now,’ I said, when we came out, ‘none of your interference here after this--do you understand?’ He laughed: ‘And how are you going to settle up with your father?’ says he. I thought I might as well jump into the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I wouldn’t, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.”
__label__di “My goodness!” shivered the clerk. “And his father,” he added, for the prince’s instruction, “and his father would have given a man a ticket to the other world for ten roubles any day--not to speak of ten thousand!”
__label__di The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than ever at this moment.
__label__di “What do you know about it?” cried the latter. “Well, my father learned the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town besides. So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for an hour. ‘This is only a foretaste,’ says he; ‘wait a bit till night comes, and I’ll come back and talk to you again.’
__label__di “Well, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. So after awhile she brought the box and flew out at him. ‘There,’ she says, ‘take your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten times dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have cost Parfen to get them! Give Parfen my compliments,’ she says, ‘and thank him very much!’ Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five roubles from a friend, and off I went to Pskoff to my aunt’s. The old woman there lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking tour round the public-houses of the place. I was in a high fever when I got to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets somewhere or other!”
__label__di “Oho! we’ll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!” giggled Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee. “Hey, my boy, we’ll get her some proper earrings now! We’ll get her such earrings that--”
__label__di “Look here,” cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, “look here, if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, I’ll tan your hide as sure as you sit there!”
__label__di “Aha! do--by all means! if you tan my hide you won’t turn me away from your society. You’ll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever. Ha, ha! here we are at the station, though.”
__label__di Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.
__label__di Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with profuse waving of hats and shouting.
__label__di “Why, there’s Zaleshoff here, too!” he muttered, gazing at the scene with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. Then he suddenly turned to the prince: “Prince, I don’t know why I have taken a fancy to you; perhaps because I met you just when I did. But no, it can’t be that, for I met this fellow” (nodding at Lebedeff) “too, and I have not taken a fancy to him by any means. Come to see me, prince; we’ll take off those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best we can buy. You shall have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat, anything you like, and your pocket shall be full of money. Come, and you shall go with me to Nastasia Philipovna’s. Now then will you come or no?”
__label__di “Accept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch” said Lebedef solemnly; “don’t let it slip! Accept, quick!”
__label__di Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he replied with some cordiality:
__label__di “I will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time, for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you especially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you before that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face. Thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon. As for money, I have hardly a copeck about me at this moment.”
__label__di “You shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so come along!”
__label__di “That’s true enough, he’ll have lots before evening!” put in Lebedeff.
__label__di “But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies? Let’s know that first?” asked Rogojin.
__label__di “Oh no, oh no!” said the prince; “I couldn’t, you know--my illness--I hardly ever saw a soul.”
__label__di “H’m! well--here, you fellow--you can come along with me now if you like!” cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage.
__label__di Lebedeff had his desire. He went off with the noisy group of Rogojin’s friends towards the Voznesensky, while the prince’s route lay towards the Litaynaya. It was damp and wet. The prince asked his way of passers-by, and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination, he determined to take a droshky.
__label__di II.
__label__di General Epanchin lived in his own house near the Litaynaya. Besides this large residence--five-sixths of which was let in flats and lodgings--the general was owner of another enormous house in the Sadovaya bringing in even more rent than the first. Besides these houses he had a delightful little estate just out of town, and some sort of factory in another part of the city. General Epanchin, as everyone knew, had a good deal to do with certain government monopolies; he was also a voice, and an important one, in many rich public companies of various descriptions; in fact, he enjoyed the reputation of being a well-to-do man of busy habits, many ties, and affluent means. He had made himself indispensable in several quarters, amongst others in his department of the government; and yet it was a known fact that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of no education whatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks.
__label__di This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own little weaknesses--very excusable ones,--one of which was a dislike to any allusion to the above circumstance. He was undoubtedly clever. For instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and because “he knew his place.” And yet if these good people could only have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who “knew his place” so well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the world and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to be carrying out other people’s ideas rather than his own. And also, his luck seldom failed him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal. He played for high stakes, and moved, altogether, in very varied society.
__label__di As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is, about fifty-five years of age,--the flowering time of existence, when real enjoyment of life begins. His healthy appearance, good colour, sound, though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during business hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening, all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make existence a bed of roses to his excellency. The general was lord of a flourishing family, consisting of his wife and three grown-up daughters. He had married young, while still a lieutenant, his wife being a girl of about his own age, who possessed neither beauty nor education, and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed property, which little estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far more important accumulations. The general never regretted his early marriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. Mrs. Epanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a brilliant, was, at all events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was extremely proud of her descent.
__label__di With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long union very happily. While still young the wife had been able to make important friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she took her place among the higher circles as by right.
__label__di During these last few years all three of the general’s daughters--Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya--had grown up and matured. Of course they were only Epanchins, but their mother’s family was noble; they might expect considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of attaining to very high rank indeed in his country’s service--all of which was satisfactory. All three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even the eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old. The middle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty. This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society. But this was not all, for every one of the three was clever, well educated, and accomplished.
__label__di It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even said that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the idol of the household, Aglaya. In society they not only disliked asserting themselves, but were actually retiring. Certainly no one could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody was well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own value. The eldest was musical, while the second was a clever artist, which fact she had concealed until lately. In a word, the world spoke well of the girls; but they were not without their enemies, and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had read.
__label__di They were in no hurry to marry. They liked good society, but were not too keen about it. All this was the more remarkable, because everyone was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents.
__label__di It was about eleven o’clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the bell at General Epanchin’s door. The general lived on the first floor or flat of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted. A liveried servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter into long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance, looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. At last, however, on the repeated positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and must absolutely see the general on business, the bewildered domestic showed him into a little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that adjoined the general’s study, there handing him over to another servant, whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the morning, and announce visitors to the general. This second individual wore a dress coat, and was some forty years of age; he was the general’s special study servant, and well aware of his own importance.
__label__di “Wait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here,” said the door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the ante-chamber. He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his knees.
__label__di “If you don’t mind, I would rather sit here with you,” said the prince; “I should prefer it to sitting in there.”
__label__di “Oh, but you can’t stay here. You are a visitor--a guest, so to speak. Is it the general himself you wish to see?”
__label__di The man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby-looking visitor, and had decided to ask once more.
__label__di “Yes--I have business--” began the prince.
__label__di “I do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to do is to announce you; and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that.”
__label__di The man’s suspicions seemed to increase more and more. The prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors; and although the general certainly did receive, on business, all sorts and conditions of men, yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular visitor. The presence of the secretary as an intermediary was, he judged, essential in this case.
__label__di “Surely you--are from abroad?” he inquired at last, in a confused sort of way. He had begun his sentence intending to say, “Surely you are not Prince Muishkin, are you?”
__label__di “Yes, straight from the train! Did not you intend to say, ‘Surely you are not Prince Muishkin?’ just now, but refrained out of politeness?”
__label__di “H’m!” grunted the astonished servant.
__label__di “I assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have to answer for me. As to my being dressed like this, and carrying a bundle, there’s nothing surprising in that--the fact is, my circumstances are not particularly rosy at this moment.”
__label__di “H’m!--no, I’m not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you, that’s all. The secretary will be out directly--that is, unless you--yes, that’s the rub--unless you--come, you must allow me to ask you--you’ve not come to beg, have you?”
__label__di “Oh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score. I have quite another matter on hand.”
__label__di “You must excuse my asking, you know. Your appearance led me to think--but just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the secretary is sure to come out.”
__label__di “Oh--well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind telling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke? I have my pipe and tobacco with me.”
__label__di “_Smoke?_” said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses. “No, sir, you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion. Ha, ha! a cool idea that, I declare!”
__label__di “Oh, I didn’t mean in this room! I know I can’t smoke here, of course. I’d adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to. You see, I’m used to smoking a good deal, and now I haven’t had a puff for three hours; however, just as you like.”
__label__di “Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?” muttered the servant. “In the first place, you’ve no right in here at all; you ought to be in the waiting-room, because you’re a sort of visitor--a guest, in fact--and I shall catch it for this. Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?” he added, glancing once more at the prince’s bundle, which evidently gave him no peace.
__label__di “No, I don’t think so. I don’t think I should stay even if they were to invite me. I’ve simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing more.”
__label__di “Make their acquaintance?” asked the man, in amazement, and with redoubled suspicion. “Then why did you say you had business with the general?”
__label__di “Oh well, very little business. There is one little matter--some advice I am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to introduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is the last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there are no other Muishkins left.”
__label__di “What--you’re a relation then, are you?” asked the servant, so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.
__label__di “Well, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course, but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once wrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply. However, I have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am telling you all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still far from comfortable on my account. All you have to do is to announce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be plain enough. If I am received--very good; if not, well, very good again. But they are sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of her family. She values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed.”
__label__di The prince’s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree, and the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common serving-man this state of things was highly improper. His conclusion was that one of two things must be the explanation--either that this was a begging impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a fool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any ambition would certainly not wait about in ante-rooms with servants, and talk of his own private affairs like this. In either case, how was he to announce this singular visitor?
__label__di “I really think I must request you to step into the next room!” he said, with all the insistence he could muster.
__label__di “Why? If I had been sitting there now, I should not have had the opportunity of making these personal explanations. I see you are still uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle. Don’t you think you might go in yourself now, without waiting for the secretary to come out?”
__label__di “No, no! I can’t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary. Besides the general said he was not to be disturbed--he is with the Colonel C--. Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without announcing.”
__label__di “Who may that be? a clerk?”
__label__di “What? Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Oh no; he belongs to one of the companies. Look here, at all events put your bundle down, here.”
__label__di “Yes, I will if I may; and--can I take off my cloak”
__label__di “Of course; you can’t go in _there_ with it on, anyhow.”
__label__di The prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat enough morning costume--a little worn, but well made. He wore a steel watch chain and from this chain there hung a silver Geneva watch. Fool the prince might be, still, the general’s servant felt that it was not correct for him to continue to converse thus with a visitor, in spite of the fact that the prince pleased him somehow.
__label__di “And what time of day does the lady receive?” the latter asked, reseating himself in his old place.
__label__di “Oh, that’s not in _my_ province! I believe she receives at any time; it depends upon the visitors. The dressmaker goes in at eleven. Gavrila Ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people, too; he is even admitted to early lunch now and then.”
__label__di “It is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season,”  observed the prince; “but it is much warmer there out of doors. As for the houses--a Russian can’t live in them in the winter until he gets accustomed to them.”
__label__di “Don’t they heat them at all?”
__label__di “Well, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves are so different to ours.”
__label__di “H’m! were you long away?”
__label__di “Four years! and I was in the same place nearly all the time,--in one village.”
__label__di “You must have forgotten Russia, hadn’t you?”
__label__di “Yes, indeed I had--a good deal; and, would you believe it, I often wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak Russian? Even now, as I talk to you, I keep saying to myself ‘how well I am speaking it.’ Perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning. I assure you, ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go on and on talking Russian.”
__label__di “H’m! yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?”
__label__di This good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples, really could not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation.
__label__di “In Petersburg? Oh no! hardly at all, and now they say so much is changed in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to relearn what they knew. They talk a good deal about the new law courts, and changes there, don’t they?”
__label__di “H’m! yes, that’s true enough. Well now, how is the law over there, do they administer it more justly than here?”
__label__di “Oh, I don’t know about that! I’ve heard much that is good about our legal administration, too. There is no capital punishment here for one thing.”
__label__di “Is there over there?”
__label__di “Yes--I saw an execution in France--at Lyons. Schneider took me over with him to see it.”
__label__di “What, did they hang the fellow?”
__label__di “No, they cut off people’s heads in France.”
__label__di “What did the fellow do?--yell?”
__label__di “Oh no--it’s the work of an instant. They put a man inside a frame and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery--they call the thing a guillotine--it falls with fearful force and weight--the head springs off so quickly that you can’t wink your eye in between. But all the preparations are so dreadful. When they announce the sentence, you know, and prepare the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to the scaffold--that’s the fearful part of the business. The people all crowd round--even women--though they don’t at all approve of women looking on.”
__label__di “No, it’s not a thing for women.”
__label__di “Of course not--of course not!--bah! The criminal was a fine intelligent fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell you--believe it or not, as you like--that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he _cried_, he did indeed,--he was as white as a bit of paper. Isn’t it a dreadful idea that he should have cried--cried! Whoever heard of a grown man crying from fear--not a child, but a man who never had cried before--a grown man of forty-five years. Imagine what must have been going on in that man’s mind at such a moment; what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the soul that’s what it is. Because it is said ‘thou shalt not kill,’ is he to be killed because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, it’s an impossible theory. I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago and it’s dancing before my eyes to this moment. I dream of it, often.”
__label__di The prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge of colour suffused his pale face, though his way of talking was as quiet as ever. The servant followed his words with sympathetic interest. Clearly he was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end. Who knows? Perhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for thought.
__label__di “Well, at all events it is a good thing that there’s no pain when the poor fellow’s head flies off,” he remarked.
__label__di “Do you know, though,” cried the prince warmly, “you made that remark now, and everyone says the same thing, and the machine is designed with the purpose of avoiding pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought came into my head then: what if it be a bad plan after all? You may laugh at my idea, perhaps--but I could not help its occurring to me all the same. Now with the rack and tortures and so on--you suffer terrible pain of course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you have plenty of that) until you die. But _here_ I should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain at all--but the certain knowledge that in an hour,--then in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now--this very _instant_--your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man--and that this is certain, _certain_! That’s the point--the certainty of it. Just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head--then--that quarter of a second is the most awful of all.
__label__di “This is not my own fantastical opinion--many people have thought the same; but I feel it so deeply that I’ll tell you what I think. I believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who is attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death. There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy--at all events hoping on in some degree--even after his throat was cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope--having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,--is taken away from the wretch and _certainty_ substituted in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death--which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world. You may place a soldier before a cannon’s mouth in battle, and fire upon him--and he will still hope. But read to that same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears. Who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad? No, no! it is an abuse, a shame, it is unnecessary--why should such a thing exist? Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved; perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards. Our Lord Christ spoke of this anguish and dread. No! no! no! No man should be treated so, no man, no man!”
__label__di The servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this as the prince did, still clearly entered into it and was greatly conciliated, as was evident from the increased amiability of his expression. “If you are really very anxious for a smoke,” he remarked, “I think it might possibly be managed, if you are very quick about it. You see they might come out and inquire for you, and you wouldn’t be on the spot. You see that door there? Go in there and you’ll find a little room on the right; you can smoke there, only open the window, because I ought not to allow it really, and--.” But there was no time, after all.
__label__di A young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment, with a bundle of papers in his hand. The footman hastened to help him take off his overcoat. The new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his eyes.
__label__di “This gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,” began the man, confidentially and almost familiarly, “that he is Prince Muishkin and a relative of Madame Epanchin’s. He has just arrived from abroad, with nothing but a bundle by way of luggage--.”
__label__di The prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the servant continued his communication in a whisper.
__label__di Gavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively, and gazed at the prince with great curiosity. At last he motioned the man aside and stepped hurriedly towards the prince.
__label__di “Are you Prince Muishkin?” he asked, with the greatest courtesy and amiability.
__label__di He was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty-eight summers, fair and of middle height; he wore a small beard, and his face was most intelligent. Yet his smile, in spite of its sweetness, was a little thin, if I may so call it, and showed his teeth too evenly; his gaze though decidedly good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too inquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable.
__label__di “Probably when he is alone he looks quite different, and hardly smiles at all!” thought the prince.
__label__di He explained about himself in a few words, very much the same as he had told the footman and Rogojin beforehand.
__label__di Gavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall something.
__label__di “Was it not you, then, who sent a letter a year or less ago--from Switzerland, I think it was--to Elizabetha Prokofievna (Mrs. Epanchin)?”
__label__di “It was.”
__label__di “Oh, then, of course they will remember who you are. You wish to see the general? I’ll tell him at once--he will be free in a minute; but you--you had better wait in the ante-chamber,--hadn’t you? Why is he here?” he added, severely, to the man.
__label__di “I tell you, sir, he wished it himself!”
__label__di At this moment the study door opened, and a military man, with a portfolio under his arm, came out talking loudly, and after bidding good-bye to someone inside, took his departure.
__label__di “You there, Gania?” cried a voice from the study, “come in here, will you?”
__label__di Gavrila Ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room hastily.
__label__di A couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice of Gania cried:
__label__di “Come in please, prince!”
__label__di III.
__label__di General Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was standing in the middle of the room, and gazed with great curiosity at the prince as he entered. He even advanced a couple of steps to meet him.
__label__di The prince came forward and introduced himself.
__label__di “Quite so,” replied the general, “and what can I do for you?”
__label__di “Oh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your acquaintance. I should not like to disturb you. I do not know your times and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived. I came straight from the station. I am come direct from Switzerland.”
__label__di The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his smile back. Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest once more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat down himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak.
__label__di Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over papers.
__label__di “I have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,” said the general, “but as, of course, you have your object in coming, I--”
__label__di “I felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved to pay you this visit,” the prince interrupted; “but I give you my word, beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object whatever.”
__label__di “The pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as you are aware. There is such a thing as business, and I really do not see what possible reason there can be, or what we have in common to--”
__label__di “Oh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is nothing in common between us, or very little; for if I am Prince Muishkin, and your wife happens to be a member of my house, that can hardly be called a ‘reason.’ I quite understand that. And yet that was my whole motive for coming. You see I have not been in Russia for four years, and knew very little about anything when I left. I had been very ill for a long time, and I feel now the need of a few good friends. In fact, I have a certain question upon which I much need advice, and do not know whom to go to for it. I thought of your family when I was passing through Berlin. ‘They are almost relations,’ I said to myself, ‘so I’ll begin with them; perhaps we may get on with each other, I with them and they with me, if they are kind people;’ and I have heard that you are very kind people!”
__label__di “Oh, thank you, thank you, I’m sure,” replied the general, considerably taken aback. “May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?”
__label__di “Nowhere, as yet.”
__label__di “What, straight from the station to my house? And how about your luggage?”
__label__di “I only had a small bundle, containing linen, with me, nothing more. I can carry it in my hand, easily. There will be plenty of time to take a room in some hotel by the evening.”
__label__di “Oh, then you _do_ intend to take a room?”
__label__di “Of course.”
__label__di “To judge from your words, you came straight to my house with the intention of staying there.”
__label__di “That could only have been on your invitation. I confess, however, that I should not have stayed here even if you had invited me, not for any particular reason, but because it is--well, contrary to my practice and nature, somehow.”
__label__di “Oh, indeed! Then it is perhaps as well that I neither _did_ invite you, nor _do_ invite you now. Excuse me, prince, but we had better make this matter clear, once for all. We have just agreed that with regard to our relationship there is not much to be said, though, of course, it would have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship did actually exist; therefore, perhaps--”
__label__di “Therefore, perhaps I had better get up and go away?” said the prince, laughing merrily as he rose from his place; just as merrily as though the circumstances were by no means strained or difficult. “And I give you my word, general, that though I know nothing whatever of manners and customs of society, and how people live and all that, yet I felt quite sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended now. Oh, well, I suppose it’s all right; especially as my letter was not answered. Well, good-bye, and forgive me for having disturbed you!”
__label__di The prince’s expression was so good-natured at this moment, and so entirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the smile with which he looked at the general as he spoke, that the latter suddenly paused, and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new point of view, all in an instant.
__label__di “Do you know, prince,” he said, in quite a different tone, “I do not know you at all, yet, and after all, Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name. Wait a little, if you don’t mind, and if you have time to spare?”
__label__di “Oh, I assure you I’ve lots of time, my time is entirely my own!” And the prince immediately replaced his soft, round hat on the table. “I confess, I thought Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely remember that I had written her a letter. Just now your servant--outside there--was dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you. I noticed that! Probably he has very strict instructions on that score; but I assure you I did not come to beg. I came to make some friends. But I am rather bothered at having disturbed you; that’s all I care about.--”
__label__di “Look here, prince,” said the general, with a cordial smile, “if you really are the sort of man you appear to be, it may be a source of great pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance; but, you see, I am a very busy man, and have to be perpetually sitting here and signing papers, or off to see his excellency, or to my department, or somewhere; so that though I should be glad to see more of people, nice people--you see, I--however, I am sure you are so well brought up that you will see at once, and--but how old are you, prince?”
__label__di “Twenty-six.”
__label__di “No? I thought you very much younger.”
__label__di “Yes, they say I have a ‘young’ face. As to disturbing you I shall soon learn to avoid doing that, for I hate disturbing people. Besides, you and I are so differently constituted, I should think, that there must be very little in common between us. Not that I will ever believe there is _nothing_ in common between any two people, as some declare is the case. I am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each other into groups, by appearances; but I am boring you, I see, you--”
__label__di “Just two words: have you any means at all? Or perhaps you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment? Excuse my questioning you, but--”
__label__di “Oh, my dear sir, I esteem and understand your kindness in putting the question. No; at present I have no means whatever, and no employment either, but I hope to find some. I was living on other people abroad. Schneider, the professor who treated me and taught me, too, in Switzerland, gave me just enough money for my journey, so that now I have but a few copecks left. There certainly is one question upon which I am anxious to have advice, but--”
__label__di “Tell me, how do you intend to live now, and what are your plans?”  interrupted the general.
__label__di “I wish to work, somehow or other.”
__label__di “Oh yes, but then, you see, you are a philosopher. Have you any talents, or ability in any direction--that is, any that would bring in money and bread? Excuse me again--”
__label__di “Oh, don’t apologize. No, I don’t think I have either talents or special abilities of any kind; on the contrary. I have always been an invalid and unable to learn much. As for bread, I should think--”
__label__di The general interrupted once more with questions; while the prince again replied with the narrative we have heard before. It appeared that the general had known Pavlicheff; but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince, that young gentleman could not explain; probably by virtue of the old friendship with his father, he thought.
__label__di The prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child, and Pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a relative of his own, living in the country, the child needing the fresh air and exercise of country life. He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by a tutor, but could not remember much about this time of his life. His fits were so frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the prince used the expression “idiot” himself). Pavlicheff had met Professor Schneider in Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to Switzerland, to Schneider’s establishment there, for the cure of his epilepsy, and, five years before this time, the prince was sent off. But Pavlicheff had died two or three years since, and Schneider had himself supported the young fellow, from that day to this, at his own expense. Although he had not quite cured him, he had greatly improved his condition; and now, at last, at the prince’s own desire, and because of a certain matter which came to the ears of the latter, Schneider had despatched the young man to Russia.
__label__di The general was much astonished.
__label__di “Then you have no one, absolutely _no_ one in Russia?” he asked.
__label__di “No one, at present; but I hope to make friends; and then I have a letter from--”
__label__di “At all events,” put in the general, not listening to the news about the letter, “at all events, you must have learned _something_, and your malady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work, in one of the departments, for instance?”
__label__di “Oh dear no, oh no! As for a situation, I should much like to find one for I am anxious to discover what I really am fit for. I have learned a good deal in the last four years, and, besides, I read a great many Russian books.”
__label__di “Russian books, indeed? Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?”
__label__di “Oh dear, yes!”
__label__di “Capital! And your handwriting?”
__label__di “Ah, there I am _really_ talented! I may say I am a real caligraphist. Let me write you something, just to show you,” said the prince, with some excitement.
__label__di “With pleasure! In fact, it is very necessary. I like your readiness, prince; in fact, I must say--I--I--like you very well, altogether,” said the general.
__label__di “What delightful writing materials you have here, such a lot of pencils and things, and what beautiful paper! It’s a charming room altogether. I know that picture, it’s a Swiss view. I’m sure the artist painted it from nature, and that I have seen the very place--”
__label__di “Quite likely, though I bought it here. Gania, give the prince some paper. Here are pens and paper; now then, take this table. What’s this?” the general continued to Gania, who had that moment taken a large photograph out of his portfolio, and shown it to his senior. “Halloa! Nastasia Philipovna! Did she send it you herself? Herself?” he inquired, with much curiosity and great animation.
__label__di “She gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate her. I asked her for it long ago. I don’t know whether she meant it for a hint that I had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,”  added Gania, with an unpleasant smile.
__label__di “Oh, nonsense, nonsense,” said the general, with decision. “What extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; that’s not her way at all. Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait, however. Has she ever asked you for it?”
__label__di “No, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you haven’t forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially invited, you know.”
__label__di “Oh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think so! She’s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So be prepared!”
__label__di Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever.
__label__di “Are you sure she said that?” he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver as he spoke.
__label__di “Yes, she promised. We both worried her so that she gave in; but she wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.”
__label__di The general watched Gania’s confusion intently, and clearly did not like it.
__label__di “Remember, Ivan Fedorovitch,” said Gania, in great agitation, “that I was to be free too, until her decision; and that even then I was to have my ‘yes or no’ free.”
__label__di “Why, don’t you, aren’t you--” began the general, in alarm.
__label__di “Oh, don’t misunderstand--”
__label__di “But, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?”
__label__di “Oh, I’m not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself badly, but I didn’t mean that.”
__label__di “Reject her! I should think not!” said the general with annoyance, and apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. “Why, my dear fellow, it’s not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you are prepared to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper satisfaction. How are things going on at home?”
__label__di “At home? Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my father will make a fool of himself, as usual. He is rapidly becoming a general nuisance. I don’t ever talk to him now, but I hold him in check, safe enough. I swear if it had not been for my mother, I should have shown him the way out, long ago. My mother is always crying, of course, and my sister sulks. I had to tell them at last that I intended to be master of my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home. At least, I gave my sister to understand as much, and my mother was present.”
__label__di “Well, I must say, I cannot understand it!” said the general, shrugging his shoulders and dropping his hands. “You remember your mother, Nina Alexandrovna, that day she came and sat here and groaned--and when I asked her what was the matter, she says, ‘Oh, it’s such a _dishonour_ to us!’ dishonour! Stuff and nonsense! I should like to know who can reproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a word of any kind against her. Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski? What nonsense it is! You would not let her come near your daughters, says Nina Alexandrovna. What next, I wonder? I don’t see how she can fail to--to understand--”
__label__di “Her own position?” prompted Gania. “She does understand. Don’t be annoyed with her. I have warned her not to meddle in other people’s affairs. However, although there’s comparative peace at home at present, the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight.”
__label__di The prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at the table, writing. He finished at last, and brought the result of his labour to the general’s desk.
__label__di “So this is Nastasia Philipovna,” he said, looking attentively and curiously at the portrait. “How wonderfully beautiful!” he immediately added, with warmth. The picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely woman. She was photographed in a black silk dress of simple design, her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were deep and thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, but proud. She was rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale. Both Gania and the general gazed at the prince in amazement.
__label__di “How do you know it’s Nastasia Philipovna?” asked the general; “you surely don’t know her already, do you?”
__label__di “Yes, I do! I have only been one day in Russia, but I have heard of the great beauty!” And the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with Rogojin in the train and the whole of the latter’s story.
__label__di “There’s news!” said the general in some excitement, after listening to the story with engrossed attention.
__label__di “Oh, of course it’s nothing but humbug!” cried Gania, a little disturbed, however. “It’s all humbug; the young merchant was pleased to indulge in a little innocent recreation! I have heard something of Rogojin!”
__label__di “Yes, so have I!” replied the general. “Nastasia Philipovna told us all about the earrings that very day. But now it is quite a different matter. You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is passionately in love. The whole story smells of passion, and we all know what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated. I am much afraid of some disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!”
__label__di “You are afraid of the million, I suppose,” said Gania, grinning and showing his teeth.
__label__di “And you are _not_, I presume, eh?”
__label__di “How did he strike you, prince?” asked Gania, suddenly. “Did he seem to be a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow? What was your own opinion about the matter?”
__label__di While Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly flashed into his brain, and blazed out, impatiently, in his eyes. The general, who was really agitated and disturbed, looked at the prince too, but did not seem to expect much from his reply.
__label__di “I really don’t quite know how to tell you,” replied the prince, “but it certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion, and not, perhaps, quite healthy passion. He seemed to be still far from well. Very likely he will be in bed again in a day or two, especially if he lives fast.”
__label__di “No! do you think so?” said the general, catching at the idea.
__label__di “Yes, I do think so!”
__label__di “Yes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment. It may be this very evening,” remarked Gania to the general, with a smile.
__label__di “Of course; quite so. In that case it all depends upon what is going on in her brain at this moment.”
__label__di “You know the kind of person she is at times.”
__label__di “How? What kind of person is she?” cried the general, arrived at the limits of his patience. “Look here, Gania, don’t you go annoying her tonight. What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you can. Well, what are you smiling at? You must understand, Gania, that I have no interest whatever in speaking like this. Whichever way the question is settled, it will be to my advantage. Nothing will move Totski from his resolution, so I run no risk. If there is anything I desire, you must know that it is your benefit only. Can’t you trust me? You are a sensible fellow, and I have been counting on you; for, in this matter, that, that--”
__label__di “Yes, that’s the chief thing,” said Gania, helping the general out of his difficulties again, and curling his lips in an envenomed smile, which he did not attempt to conceal. He gazed with his fevered eyes straight into those of the general, as though he were anxious that the latter might read his thoughts.
__label__di The general grew purple with anger.
__label__di “Yes, of course it is the chief thing!” he cried, looking sharply at Gania. “What a very curious man you are, Gania! You actually seem to be _glad_ to hear of this millionaire fellow’s arrival--just as though you wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing. This is an affair in which you ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due warning, to avoid compromising others. But, even now, there is still time. Do you understand me? I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not? If not, say so,--and--and welcome! No one is trying to force you into the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if you see a snare in the matter, at least.”
__label__di “I do desire it,” murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes; and he relapsed into gloomy silence.
__label__di The general was satisfied. He had excited himself, and was evidently now regretting that he had gone so far. He turned to the prince, and suddenly the disagreeable thought of the latter’s presence struck him, and the certainty that he must have heard every word of the conversation. But he felt at ease in another moment; it only needed one glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear.
__label__di “Oh!” cried the general, catching sight of the prince’s specimen of caligraphy, which the latter had now handed him for inspection. “Why, this is simply beautiful; look at that, Gania, there’s real talent there!”
__label__di On a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written in medieval characters the legend:
__label__di “The gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.”
__label__di “There,” explained the prince, with great delight and animation, “there, that’s the abbot’s real signature--from a manuscript of the fourteenth century. All these old abbots and bishops used to write most beautifully, with such taste and so much care and diligence. Have you no copy of Pogodin, general? If you had one I could show you another type. Stop a bit--here you have the large round writing common in France during the eighteenth century. Some of the letters are shaped quite differently from those now in use. It was the writing current then, and employed by public writers generally. I copied this from one of them, and you can see how good it is. Look at the well-rounded a and d. I have tried to translate the French character into the Russian letters--a difficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly. Here is a fine sentence, written in a good, original hand--‘Zeal triumphs over all.’ That is the script of the Russian War Office. That is how official documents addressed to important personages should be written. The letters are round, the type black, and the style somewhat remarkable. A stylist would not allow these ornaments, or attempts at flourishes--just look at these unfinished tails!--but it has distinction and really depicts the soul of the writer. He would like to give play to his imagination, and follow the inspiration of his genius, but a soldier is only at ease in the guard-room, and the pen stops half-way, a slave to discipline. How delightful! The first time I met an example of this handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you think I chanced to find it? In Switzerland, of all places! Now that is an ordinary English hand. It can hardly be improved, it is so refined and exquisite--almost perfection. This is an example of another kind, a mixture of styles. The copy was given me by a French commercial traveller. It is founded on the English, but the downstrokes are a little blacker, and more marked. Notice that the oval has some slight modification--it is more rounded. This writing allows for flourishes; now a flourish is a dangerous thing! Its use requires such taste, but, if successful, what a distinction it gives to the whole! It results in an incomparable type--one to fall in love with!”
__label__di “Dear me! How you have gone into all the refinements and details of the question! Why, my dear fellow, you are not a caligraphist, you are an artist! Eh, Gania?”
__label__di “Wonderful!” said Gania. “And he knows it too,” he added, with a sarcastic smile.
__label__di “You may smile,--but there’s a career in this,” said the general. “You don’t know what a great personage I shall show this to, prince. Why, you can command a situation at thirty-five roubles per month to start with. However, it’s half-past twelve,” he concluded, looking at his watch; “so to business, prince, for I must be setting to work and shall not see you again today. Sit down a minute. I have told you that I cannot receive you myself very often, but I should like to be of some assistance to you, some small assistance, of a kind that would give you satisfaction. I shall find you a place in one of the State departments, an easy place--but you will require to be accurate. Now, as to your plans--in the house, or rather in the family of Gania here--my young friend, whom I hope you will know better--his mother and sister have prepared two or three rooms for lodgers, and let them to highly recommended young fellows, with board and attendance. I am sure Nina Alexandrovna will take you in on my recommendation. There you will be comfortable and well taken care of; for I do not think, prince, that you are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of Fate in a town like Petersburg. Nina Alexandrovna, Gania’s mother, and Varvara Alexandrovna, are ladies for whom I have the highest possible esteem and respect. Nina Alexandrovna is the wife of General Ardalion Alexandrovitch, my old brother in arms, with whom, I regret to say, on account of certain circumstances, I am no longer acquainted. I give you all this information, prince, in order to make it clear to you that I am personally recommending you to this family, and that in so doing, I am more or less taking upon myself to answer for you. The terms are most reasonable, and I trust that your salary will very shortly prove amply sufficient for your expenditure. Of course pocket-money is a necessity, if only a little; do not be angry, prince, if I strongly recommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket. But as your purse is quite empty at the present moment, you must allow me to press these twenty-five roubles upon your acceptance, as something to begin with. Of course we will settle this little matter another time, and if you are the upright, honest man you look, I anticipate very little trouble between us on that score. Taking so much interest in you as you may perceive I do, I am not without my object, and you shall know it in good time. You see, I am perfectly candid with you. I hope, Gania, you have nothing to say against the prince’s taking up his abode in your house?”
__label__di “Oh, on the contrary! my mother will be very glad,” said Gania, courteously and kindly.
__label__di “I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not? That fellow Ferd-Ferd--”
__label__di “Ferdishenko.”
__label__di “Yes--I don’t like that Ferdishenko. I can’t understand why Nastasia Philipovna encourages him so. Is he really her cousin, as he says?”
__label__di “Oh dear no, it’s all a joke. No more cousin than I am.”
__label__di “Well, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?”
__label__di “Thank you, general; you have behaved very kindly to me; all the more so since I did not ask you to help me. I don’t say that out of pride. I certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight. Rogojin asked me to come to his house, of course, but--”
__label__di “Rogojin? No, no, my good fellow. I should strongly recommend you, paternally,--or, if you prefer it, as a friend,--to forget all about Rogojin, and, in fact, to stick to the family into which you are about to enter.”
__label__di “Thank you,” began the prince; “and since you are so very kind there is just one matter which I--”
__label__di “You must really excuse me,” interrupted the general, “but I positively haven’t another moment now. I shall just tell Elizabetha Prokofievna about you, and if she wishes to receive you at once--as I shall advise her--I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in many ways. If she cannot receive you now, you must be content to wait till another time. Meanwhile you, Gania, just look over these accounts, will you? We mustn’t forget to finish off that matter--”
__label__di The general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching the business which he had on hand, though he had endeavoured to do so four times.
__label__di Gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. The latter accepted the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to disturb Gania’s work. He commenced to examine the study and its contents. But Gania hardly so much as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was absent and thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together.
__label__di Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over Nastasia Philipovna’s portrait, gazing at it.
__label__di “Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?” he asked, looking intently at him. He seemed to have some special object in the question.
__label__di “It’s a wonderful face,” said the prince, “and I feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly--hasn’t she? Her eyes show it--those two bones there, the little points under her eyes, just where the cheek begins. It’s a proud face too, terribly proud! And I--I can’t say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but good! That would make all well!”
__label__di “And would you marry a woman like that, now?” continued Gania, never taking his excited eyes off the prince’s face.
__label__di “I cannot marry at all,” said the latter. “I am an invalid.”
__label__di “Would Rogojin marry her, do you think?”
__label__di “Why not? Certainly he would, I should think. He would marry her tomorrow!--marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week!”
__label__di Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out.
__label__di “What’s the matter?” said he, seizing Gania’s hand.
__label__di “Your highness! His excellency begs your presence in her excellency’s apartments!” announced the footman, appearing at the door.
__label__di The prince immediately followed the man out of the room.
__label__di IV.
__label__di All three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy girls, well-grown, with good shoulders and busts, and strong--almost masculine--hands; and, of course, with all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital appetites, of which they were not in the least ashamed.
__label__di Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward deference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave, had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had judged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was well aware of the fact.
__label__di It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten o’clock, while still in bed. This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At half-past twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if he had time.
__label__di Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various kinds (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on, there was generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies.
__label__di On the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had assembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the general’s appearance, the latter having promised to come this day. If he had been one moment late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up punctually.
__label__di As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as his custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill. He thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not altogether comfortable. His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in their expression as well.
__label__di The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to be too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an experienced father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at once to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air.
__label__di However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order to explain the mutual relations between General Epanchin’s family and others acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the thread of their destiny. I have already stated that the general, though he was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that, an experienced and talented husband and father. Among other things, he considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grown-up daughters. He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this question, though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish, because unnatural; but the general’s arguments were conclusive, and founded upon obvious facts. The general considered that the girls’ taste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately, and that the parents’ duty should merely be to keep watch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made; but that the selection once effected, both father and mother were bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause, and to see that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily reached.
__label__di Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchins’ position gained each year, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and social weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better was their chance of making a brilliant match.
__label__di But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more, equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her twenty-fifth birthday. Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty.
__label__di Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. Might he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general’s daughters?
__label__di Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the Epanchins was about to undergo a change.
__label__di The undoubted beauty of the family, _par excellence_, was the youngest, Aglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself, though an egotist of the extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was clearly not for such as he.
__label__di Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or less exaggerated Aglaya’s chances of happiness. In their opinion, the latter’s destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a heaven on earth. Aglaya’s husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth. The two elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need be, for Aglaya’s sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented.
__label__di The general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore, when Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer, since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. The general valued the proposal very highly. He knew life, and realized what such an offer was worth.
__label__di The answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive, at least consoling and hopeful. It made known that the eldest, Alexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.
__label__di Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own. She was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski, she would make him a good wife. She did not care for a brilliant marriage; she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome. What better could Totski wish?
__label__di So the matter crept slowly forward. The general and Totski had agreed to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. Alexandra’s parents had not even begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when suddenly, as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the proceedings. Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and that was a serious matter. A certain circumstance had crept in, a disagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the whole business.
__label__di This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. Close to an estate of Totski’s, in one of the central provinces of Russia, there lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description. This gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards family and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate was mortgaged to the last acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and that his wife had perished with it, but his children were safe.
__label__di Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could not stand this last stroke. He went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little girls--two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,--were adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart. They were brought up together with the children of his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them left--Nastasia Philipovna--for the other little one died of whooping-cough. Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff’s house, he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality--as to which last Totski was an undoubted authority.
__label__di He only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion, but he had time to make his arrangements. Great changes took place in the child’s education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of experience and culture. For four years this lady resided in the house with little Nastia, and then the education was considered complete. The governess took her departure, and another lady came down to fetch Nastia, by Totski’s instructions. The child was now transported to another of Totski’s estates in a distant part of the country. Here she found a delightful little house, just built, and prepared for her reception with great care and taste; and here she took up her abode together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home. In the house there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of all sorts, a charming “young lady’s library,” pictures, paint-boxes, a lap-dog, and everything to make life agreeable. Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer, staying two and three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully and happily, in charming surroundings.
__label__di At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski’s last visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only partially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski’s house, all alone.
__label__di The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure; but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone. An entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the girl he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in common.
__label__di In the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was usual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. Surely not from her “young lady’s library”? It even embraced legal matters, and the “world” in general, to a considerable extent.
__label__di Her character was absolutely changed. No more of the girlish alternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the reveries, the tears, the playfulness... It was an entirely new and hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him, and informed him to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind, except loathing and contempt--contempt which had followed closely upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first acquaintance with him.
__label__di This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to prevent this marriage--for no particular reason, but that she _chose_ to do so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was “quite her turn to laugh a little now!”
__label__di Such were her words--very likely she did not give her real reason for this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the explanation she deigned to offer.
__label__di Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas would permit. His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at the end of that time his resolution was taken. The fact was, Totski was at that time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and respectable; his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe foundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position better than all the world, as every respectable gentleman should!
__label__di At the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only threaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no one.
__label__di There was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm of the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against whom or what, some insatiable contempt--in a word, something altogether absurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.
__label__di For a man of Totski’s wealth and standing, it would, of course, have been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at once from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia Philipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a scandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove her to a sphere of safety. However, these arguments would only hold good in case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency. She was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some extraordinary eccentricity.
__label__di Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead. He realized that Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing by legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some entirely different intention.
__label__di Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of perpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense of loathing and contempt. He had sufficient insight to understand that she valued nothing in the world--herself least of all--and he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects. For instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar, or publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened; but not so much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted, as at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of society.
__label__di He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound him and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo, Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. His decision was strengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered of late. It would be difficult to conceive how different she was physically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago. She was pretty then... but now!... Totski laughed angrily when he thought how short-sighted he had been. In days gone by he remembered how he had looked at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their dark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek an answer to some unknown riddle. Her complexion also had altered. She was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her more beautiful. Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised such a cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think differently about it. It had struck him as long ago as last spring that he ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office in another part of the country. How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the idea of such a thing, now!
__label__di However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another way; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command. In this way he might gain glory in certain circles.
__label__di Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that time a great deal happened. Totski’s position was very uncomfortable; having “funked” once, he could not totally regain his ease. He was afraid, he did not know why, but he was simply _afraid_ of Nastasia Philipovna. For the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so. He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side. But to his great, and not entirely pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case, and that were he to offer himself he would be refused. He could not understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude that it was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative woman, which had gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour. To make matters worse, she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations, and could not be bribed in any way.
__label__di Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free. He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he invited princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists, even Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest impression upon Nastasia. It was as though she had a pebble in place of a heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered for ever.
__label__di She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved music. Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a couple of actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher. Among these people she was much beloved.
__label__di She received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening. Totski often came. Lately, too, General Epanchin had been enabled with great difficulty to introduce himself into her circle. Gania made her acquaintance also, and others were Ferdishenko, an ill-bred, and would-be witty, young clerk, and Ptitsin, a money-lender of modest and polished manners, who had risen from poverty. In fact, Nastasia Philipovna’s beauty became a thing known to all the town; but not a single man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for her; and this reputation of hers, and her wit and culture and grace, all confirmed Totski in the plan he had now prepared.
__label__di And it was at this moment that General Epanchin began to play so large and important a part in the story.
__label__di When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full and candid confession. He had said that he intended to stop at no means to obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her; words were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some sort. So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. Having arrived at Nastasia’s house one day, with Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position. He admitted that he was to blame for all, but candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power over himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry at last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart.
__label__di General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the arbiter of Totski’s destiny at this moment. He then pointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his other daughters, now hung upon her reply.
__label__di To Nastasia’s question as to what they wished her to do, Totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. He immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course, be absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. He very well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good family, namely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted, and whom she received at her house, had long loved her passionately, and would give his life for some response from her. The young fellow had confessed this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it in the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin. Lastly, he could not help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware of Gania’s love for her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she had looked with some favour upon it, being often lonely, and rather tired of her present life. Having remarked how difficult it was for him, of all people, to speak to her of these matters, Totski concluded by saying that he trusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of seventy-five thousand roubles. He added that the sum would have been left her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything, but that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be allowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc., etc.; in fact, all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. Totski was very eloquent all through, and, in conclusion, just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world, not even General Epanchin, had ever heard a word about the above seventy-five thousand roubles, and that this was the first time he had ever given expression to his intentions in respect to them.
__label__di Nastasia Philipovna’s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the friends considerably.
__label__di Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which sent a cold chill down Totski’s back to this very day; but she seemed charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him for once in a way. She confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but that pride had hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was broken, nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity.
__label__di First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes, she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now quite out of the question. She said that she had long since changed her views of things, and recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart. What was done was done and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should still feel alarmed.
__label__di She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously, that she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard none but good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep and sincere respect. The idea alone that she could in any way serve them, would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness.
__label__di It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged her thoughts aright. She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to family life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila Ardalionovitch, she could not as yet say much. She thought it must be the case that he loved her; she felt that she too might learn to love him, if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself; but he was very young, and it was a difficult question to decide. What she specially liked about him was that he worked, and supported his family by his toil.
__label__di She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that was interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from Mr. Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance, but--another question!--would they like to receive her into their house? At all events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she desired not to be hurried. As for the seventy-five thousand roubles, Mr. Totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter; she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift. She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no reason why Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.
__label__di She would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt persuaded that neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any sort of concealed suspicions as to herself. She did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything in the past, which fact she desired to be known. She did not consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch should be informed as to the relations which had existed between herself and Totski during the last five years. If she accepted this money it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl, which had not been in any degree her own fault, but merely as compensation for her ruined life.
__label__di She became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and confessions that General Epanchin was highly gratified, and considered the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. But the once bitten Totski was twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers. However, the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring about their object (namely, Gania’s attractiveness for Nastasia Philipovna), stood out more and more prominently; the pourparlers had commenced, and gradually even Totski began to believe in the possibility of success.
__label__di Before long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter over. Very little was said--her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing such a question. But she recognized his love, on the understanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever, and that she reserved the right to say “no” up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony. Gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last moment.
__label__di It soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and quarrellings at the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the match, and that Nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident. She said nothing about it, though he daily expected her to do so.
__label__di There were several rumours afloat, before long, which upset Totski’s equanimity a good deal, but we will not now stop to describe them; merely mentioning an instance or two. One was that Nastasia had entered into close and secret relations with the Epanchin girls--a most unlikely rumour; another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and that his nature was gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary degree; and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest before, yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for their own purposes, it was clear enough that he had begun to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare.
__label__di In his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway, and although he had at last given his consent to marry the woman (as he said), under the stress of circumstances, yet he promised himself that he would “take it out of her,” after marriage.
__label__di Nastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and to be preparing something on her own account, which frightened him to such an extent that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. But at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances.
__label__di However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short time.
__label__di A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that the respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion. What he thought to gain by Gania’s marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine. Possibly he counted on Gania’s complaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding between the general and his secretary. At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia’s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. The day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband’s infidelities, had heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest. The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place--which fact alarmed him much.
__label__di This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family. Before the prince’s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business, and “cut” the meal; which simply meant running away.
__label__di He was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed--especially the evening--without unpleasantness between himself and his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned up--“as though Heaven had sent him on purpose,” said the general to himself, as he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom.
__label__di Mrs. General Epanchin was a proud woman by nature. What must her feelings have been when she heard that Prince Muishkin, the last of his and her line, had arrived in beggar’s guise, a wretched idiot, a recipient of charity--all of which details the general gave out for greater effect! He was anxious to steal her interest at the first swoop, so as to distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight, and staring before her, without speaking, in moments of excitement.
__label__di She was a fine woman of the same age as her husband, with a slightly hooked nose, a high, narrow forehead, thick hair turning a little grey, and a sallow complexion. Her eyes were grey and wore a very curious expression at times. She believed them to be most effective--a belief that nothing could alter.
__label__di “What, receive him! Now, at once?” asked Mrs. Epanchin, gazing vaguely at her husband as he stood fidgeting before her.
__label__di “Oh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with him,” the general explained hastily. “He is quite a child, not to say a pathetic-looking creature. He has fits of some sort, and has just arrived from Switzerland, straight from the station, dressed like a German and without a farthing in his pocket. I gave him twenty-five roubles to go on with, and am going to find him some easy place in one of the government offices. I should like you to ply him well with the victuals, my dears, for I should think he must be very hungry.”
__label__di “You astonish me,” said the lady, gazing as before. “Fits, and hungry too! What sort of fits?”
__label__di “Oh, they don’t come on frequently, besides, he’s a regular child, though he seems to be fairly educated. I should like you, if possible, my dears,” the general added, making slowly for the door, “to put him through his paces a bit, and see what he is good for. I think you should be kind to him; it is a good deed, you know--however, just as you like, of course--but he is a sort of relation, remember, and I thought it might interest you to see the young fellow, seeing that this is so.”
__label__di “Oh, of course, mamma, if we needn’t stand on ceremony with him, we must give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey; especially as he has not the least idea where to go to,” said Alexandra, the eldest of the girls.
__label__di “Besides, he’s quite a child; we can entertain him with a little hide-and-seek, in case of need,” said Adelaida.
__label__di “Hide-and-seek? What do you mean?” inquired Mrs. Epanchin.
__label__di “Oh, do stop pretending, mamma,” cried Aglaya, in vexation. “Send him up, father; mother allows.”
__label__di The general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be shown in.
__label__di “Only on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,”  said Mrs. Epanchin, “and let Fedor, or Mavra, stand behind him while he eats. Is he quiet when he has these fits? He doesn’t show violence, does he?”
__label__di “On the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up. His manners are excellent--but here he is himself. Here you are, prince--let me introduce you, the last of the Muishkins, a relative of your own, my dear, or at least of the same name. Receive him kindly, please. They’ll bring in lunch directly, prince; you must stop and have some, but you must excuse me. I’m in a hurry, I must be off--”
__label__di “We all know where _you_ must be off to!” said Mrs. Epanchin, in a meaning voice.
__label__di “Yes, yes--I must hurry away, I’m late! Look here, dears, let him write you something in your albums; you’ve no idea what a wonderful caligraphist he is, wonderful talent! He has just written out ‘Abbot Pafnute signed this’ for me. Well, _au revoir!_”
__label__di “Stop a minute; where are you off to? Who is this abbot?” cried Mrs. Epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance.
__label__di “Yes, my dear, it was an old abbot of that name--I must be off to see the count, he’s waiting for me, I’m late--Good-bye! _Au revoir_, prince!”--and the general bolted at full speed.
__label__di “Oh, yes--I know what count you’re going to see!” remarked his wife in a cutting manner, as she turned her angry eyes on the prince. “Now then, what’s all this about?--What abbot--Who’s Pafnute?” she added, brusquely.
__label__di “Mamma!” said Alexandra, shocked at her rudeness.
__label__di Aglaya stamped her foot.
__label__di “Nonsense! Let me alone!” said the angry mother. “Now then, prince, sit down here, no, nearer, come nearer the light! I want to have a good look at you. So, now then, who is this abbot?”
__label__di “Abbot Pafnute,” said our friend, seriously and with deference.
__label__di “Pafnute, yes. And who was he?”
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely, and when the prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said.
__label__di “The Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,” began the prince; “he was in charge of one of the monasteries on the Volga, about where our present Kostroma government lies. He went to Oreol and helped in the great matters then going on in the religious world; he signed an edict there, and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me, so I copied it. When the general asked me, in his study, to write something for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote ‘The Abbot Pafnute signed this,’ in the exact handwriting of the abbot. The general liked it very much, and that’s why he recalled it just now.”
__label__di “Aglaya, make a note of ‘Pafnute,’ or we shall forget him. H’m! and where is this signature?”
__label__di “I think it was left on the general’s table.”
__label__di “Let it be sent for at once!”
__label__di “Oh, I’ll write you a new one in half a minute,” said the prince, “if you like!”
__label__di “Of course, mamma!” said Alexandra. “But let’s have lunch now, we are all hungry!”
__label__di “Yes; come along, prince,” said the mother, “are you very hungry?”
__label__di “Yes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very much.”
__label__di “H’m! I like to see that you know your manners; and you are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to describe you. Come along; you sit here, opposite to me,” she continued, “I wish to be able to see your face. Alexandra, Adelaida, look after the prince! He doesn’t seem so very ill, does he? I don’t think he requires a napkin under his chin, after all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?”
__label__di “Formerly, when I was seven years old or so. I believe I wore one; but now I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat.”
__label__di “Of course, of course! And about your fits?”
__label__di “Fits?” asked the prince, slightly surprised. “I very seldom have fits nowadays. I don’t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate may be bad for me.”
__label__di “He talks very well, you know!” said Mrs. Epanchin, who still continued to nod at each word the prince spoke. “I really did not expect it at all; in fact, I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general’s part, as usual. Eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and where you were brought up. I wish to know all about you, you interest me very much!”
__label__di The prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the while, recommenced the narrative of his life in Switzerland, all of which we have heard before. Mrs. Epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest; the girls, too, listened with considerable attention. In talking over the question of relationship it turned out that the prince was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree off by heart. It was found that scarcely any connection existed between himself and Mrs. Epanchin, but the talk, and the opportunity of conversing about her family tree, gratified the latter exceedingly, and she rose from the table in great good humour.
__label__di “Let’s all go to my boudoir,” she said, “and they shall bring some coffee in there. That’s the room where we all assemble and busy ourselves as we like best,” she explained. “Alexandra, my eldest, here, plays the piano, or reads or sews; Adelaida paints landscapes and portraits (but never finishes any); and Aglaya sits and does nothing. I don’t work too much, either. Here we are, now; sit down, prince, near the fire and talk to us. I want to hear you relate something. I wish to make sure of you first and then tell my old friend, Princess Bielokonski, about you. I wish you to know all the good people and to interest them. Now then, begin!”
__label__di “Mamma, it’s rather a strange order, that!” said Adelaida, who was fussing among her paints and paint-brushes at the easel. Aglaya and Alexandra had settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa, evidently meaning to be listeners. The prince felt that the general attention was concentrated upon himself.
__label__di “I should refuse to say a word if _I_ were ordered to tell a story like that!” observed Aglaya.
__label__di “Why? what’s there strange about it? He has a tongue. Why shouldn’t he tell us something? I want to judge whether he is a good story-teller; anything you like, prince--how you liked Switzerland, what was your first impression, anything. You’ll see, he’ll begin directly and tell us all about it beautifully.”
__label__di “The impression was forcible--” the prince began.
__label__di “There, you see, girls,” said the impatient lady, “he _has_ begun, you see.”
__label__di “Well, then, _let_ him talk, mamma,” said Alexandra. “This prince is a great humbug and by no means an idiot,” she whispered to Aglaya.
__label__di “Oh, I saw that at once,” replied the latter. “I don’t think it at all nice of him to play a part. What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?”
__label__di “My first impression was a very strong one,” repeated the prince. “When they took me away from Russia, I remember I passed through many German towns and looked out of the windows, but did not trouble so much as to ask questions about them. This was after a long series of fits. I always used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series, and lost my memory almost entirely; and though I was not altogether without reason at such times, yet I had no logical power of thought. This would continue for three or four days, and then I would recover myself again. I remember my melancholy was intolerable; I felt inclined to cry; I sat and wondered and wondered uncomfortably; the consciousness that everything was strange weighed terribly upon me; I could understand that it was all foreign and strange. I recollect I awoke from this state for the first time at Basle, one evening; the bray of a donkey aroused me, a donkey in the town market. I saw the donkey and was extremely pleased with it, and from that moment my head seemed to clear.”
__label__di “A donkey? How strange! Yet it is not strange. Anyone of us might fall in love with a donkey! It happened in mythological times,” said Madame Epanchin, looking wrathfully at her daughters, who had begun to laugh. “Go on, prince.”
__label__di “Since that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys. I began to ask questions about them, for I had never seen one before; and I at once came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of animals--strong, willing, patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey, I began to like the whole country I was travelling through; and my melancholy passed away.”
__label__di “All this is very strange and interesting,” said Mrs. Epanchin. “Now let’s leave the donkey and go on to other matters. What are you laughing at, Aglaya? and you too, Adelaida? The prince told us his experiences very cleverly; he saw the donkey himself, and what have you ever seen? _you_ have never been abroad.”
__label__di “I have seen a donkey though, mamma!” said Aglaya.
__label__di “And I’ve heard one!” said Adelaida. All three of the girls laughed out loud, and the prince laughed with them.
__label__di “Well, it’s too bad of you,” said mamma. “You must forgive them, prince; they are good girls. I am very fond of them, though I often have to be scolding them; they are all as silly and mad as march hares.”
__label__di “Oh, why shouldn’t they laugh?” said the prince. “I shouldn’t have let the chance go by in their place, I know. But I stick up for the donkey, all the same; he’s a patient, good-natured fellow.”
__label__di “Are you a patient man, prince? I ask out of curiosity,” said Mrs. Epanchin.
__label__di All laughed again.
__label__di “Oh, that wretched donkey again, I see!” cried the lady. “I assure you, prince, I was not guilty of the least--”
__label__di “Insinuation? Oh! I assure you, I take your word for it.” And the prince continued laughing merrily.
__label__di “I must say it’s very nice of you to laugh. I see you really are a kind-hearted fellow,” said Mrs. Epanchin.
__label__di “I’m not always kind, though.”
__label__di “I am kind myself, and _always_ kind too, if you please!” she retorted, unexpectedly; “and that is my chief fault, for one ought not to be always kind. I am often angry with these girls and their father; but the worst of it is, I am always kindest when I am cross. I was very angry just before you came, and Aglaya there read me a lesson--thanks, Aglaya, dear--come and kiss me--there--that’s enough” she added, as Aglaya came forward and kissed her lips and then her hand. “Now then, go on, prince. Perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the donkey, eh?”
__label__di “I must say, again, _I_ can’t understand how you can expect anyone to tell you stories straight away, so,” said Adelaida. “I know I never could!”
__label__di “Yes, but the prince can, because he is clever--cleverer than you are by ten or twenty times, if you like. There, that’s so, prince; and seriously, let’s drop the donkey now--what else did you see abroad, besides the donkey?”
__label__di “Yes, but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly, all the same,” said Alexandra. “I have always been most interested to hear how people go mad and get well again, and that sort of thing. Especially when it happens suddenly.”
__label__di “Quite so, quite so!” cried Mrs. Epanchin, delighted. “I see you _can_ be sensible now and then, Alexandra. You were speaking of Switzerland, prince?”
__label__di “Yes. We came to Lucerne, and I was taken out in a boat. I felt how lovely it was, but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other, and made me feel melancholy.”
__label__di “Why?” asked Alexandra.
__label__di “I don’t know; I always feel like that when I look at the beauties of nature for the first time; but then, I was ill at that time, of course!”
__label__di “Oh, but I should like to see it!” said Adelaida; “and I don’t know _when_ we shall ever go abroad. I’ve been two years looking out for a good subject for a picture. I’ve done all I know. ‘The North and South I know by heart,’ as our poet observes. Do help me to a subject, prince.”
__label__di “Oh, but I know nothing about painting. It seems to me one only has to look, and paint what one sees.”
__label__di “But I don’t know _how_ to see!”
__label__di “Nonsense, what rubbish you talk!” the mother struck in. “Not know how to see! Open your eyes and look! If you can’t see here, you won’t see abroad either. Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!”
__label__di “Yes, that’s better,” said Adelaida; “the prince _learned to see_ abroad.”
__label__di “Oh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my health. I don’t know whether I learned to see, exactly. I was very happy, however, nearly all the time.”
__label__di “Happy! you can be happy?” cried Aglaya. “Then how can you say you did not learn to see? I should think you could teach _us_ to see!”
__label__di “Oh! _do_ teach us,” laughed Adelaida.
__label__di “Oh! I can’t do that,” said the prince, laughing too. “I lived almost all the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you? At first I was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to improve--then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the longer I stayed, the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I could not help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult to say.”
__label__di “So that you didn’t care to go away anywhere else?”
__label__di “Well, at first I did; I was restless; I didn’t know however I should manage to support life--you know there are such moments, especially in solitude. There was a waterfall near us, such a lovely thin streak of water, like a thread but white and moving. It fell from a great height, but it looked quite low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not seem fifty paces. I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then that I became so restless. Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the terrible silence, with our little village in the distance, and the sky so blue, and the sun so bright, and an old ruined castle on the mountain-side, far away. I used to watch the line where earth and sky met, and longed to go and seek there the key of all mysteries, thinking that I might find there a new life, perhaps some great city where life should be grander and richer--and then it struck me that life may be grand enough even in a prison.”
__label__di “I read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual, when I was twelve years old,” said Aglaya.
__label__di “All this is pure philosophy,” said Adelaida. “You are a philosopher, prince, and have come here to instruct us in your views.”
__label__di “Perhaps you are right,” said the prince, smiling. “I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?”
__label__di “Your philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know, who is rich and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend. She talks of nothing but money all day. Your great philosophical idea of a grand life in a prison and your four happy years in that Swiss village are like this, rather,” said Aglaya.
__label__di “As to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,” said the prince. “I once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a prison--I heard it from the man himself. He was one of the persons under treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy, then he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide. _His_ life in prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating--but I think I had better tell you of another man I met last year. There was a very strange feature in this case, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. This man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime. Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt. He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience.
__label__di “About twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the criminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. My friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up. A priest went about among them with a cross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live.
__label__di “He said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time into portions--one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a last look around. He remembered having divided his time like this quite well. While saying good-bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in the answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. A little way off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.
__label__di “The repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea, ‘What should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to life again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!’ He said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it.”
__label__di The prince paused and all waited, expecting him to go on again and finish the story.
__label__di “Is that all?” asked Aglaya.
__label__di “All? Yes,” said the prince, emerging from a momentary reverie.
__label__di “And why did you tell us this?”
__label__di “Oh, I happened to recall it, that’s all! It fitted into the conversation--”
__label__di “You probably wish to deduce, prince,” said Alexandra, “that moments of time cannot be reckoned by money value, and that sometimes five minutes are worth priceless treasures. All this is very praiseworthy; but may I ask about this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience of his life? He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they did restore to him that ‘eternity of days.’ What did he do with these riches of time? Did he keep careful account of his minutes?”
__label__di “Oh no, he didn’t! I asked him myself. He said that he had not lived a bit as he had intended, and had wasted many, and many a minute.”
__label__di “Very well, then there’s an experiment, and the thing is proved; one cannot live and count each moment; say what you like, but one _cannot_.”
__label__di “That is true,” said the prince, “I have thought so myself. And yet, why shouldn’t one do it?”
__label__di “You think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?”  said Aglaya.
__label__di “I have had that idea.”
__label__di “And you have it still?”
__label__di “Yes--I have it still,” the prince replied.
__label__di He had contemplated Aglaya until now, with a pleasant though rather timid smile, but as the last words fell from his lips he began to laugh, and looked at her merrily.
__label__di “You are not very modest!” said she.
__label__di “But how brave you are!” said he. “You are laughing, and I--that man’s tale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of it afterwards; yes, I dreamt of those five minutes...”
__label__di He looked at his listeners again with that same serious, searching expression.
__label__di “You are not angry with me?” he asked suddenly, and with a kind of nervous hurry, although he looked them straight in the face.
__label__di “Why should we be angry?” they cried.
__label__di “Only because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the time!”
__label__di At this they laughed heartily.
__label__di “Please don’t be angry with me,” continued the prince. “I know very well that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less knowledge of it. I must appear to speak strangely sometimes...”
__label__di He said the last words nervously.
__label__di “You say you have been happy, and that proves you have lived, not less, but more than other people. Why make all these excuses?” interrupted Aglaya in a mocking tone of voice. “Besides, you need not mind about lecturing us; you have nothing to boast of. With your quietism, one could live happily for a hundred years at least. One might show you the execution of a felon, or show you one’s little finger. You could draw a moral from either, and be quite satisfied. That sort of existence is easy enough.”
__label__di “I can’t understand why you always fly into a temper,” said Mrs. Epanchin, who had been listening to the conversation and examining the faces of the speakers in turn. “I do not understand what you mean. What has your little finger to do with it? The prince talks well, though he is not amusing. He began all right, but now he seems sad.”
__label__di “Never mind, mamma! Prince, I wish you had seen an execution,” said Aglaya. “I should like to ask you a question about that, if you had.”
__label__di “I have seen an execution,” said the prince.
__label__di “You have!” cried Aglaya. “I might have guessed it. That’s a fitting crown to the rest of the story. If you have seen an execution, how can you say you lived happily all the while?”
__label__di “But is there capital punishment where you were?” asked Adelaida.
__label__di “I saw it at Lyons. Schneider took us there, and as soon as we arrived we came in for that.”
__label__di “Well, and did you like it very much? Was it very edifying and instructive?” asked Aglaya.
__label__di “No, I didn’t like it at all, and was ill after seeing it; but I confess I stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight. I could not tear them away.”
__label__di “I, too, should have been unable to tear my eyes away,” said Aglaya.
__label__di “They do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there. The women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers.”
__label__di “That is, by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit that it is a sight for men. I congratulate them on the deduction. I suppose you quite agree with them, prince?”
__label__di “Tell us about the execution,” put in Adelaida.
__label__di “I would much rather not, just now,” said the prince, a little disturbed and frowning slightly.
__label__di “You don’t seem to want to tell us,” said Aglaya, with a mocking air.
__label__di “No,--the thing is, I was telling all about the execution a little while ago, and--”
__label__di “Whom did you tell about it?”
__label__di “The man-servant, while I was waiting to see the general.”
__label__di “Our man-servant?” exclaimed several voices at once.
__label__di “Yes, the one who waits in the entrance hall, a greyish, red-faced man--”
__label__di “The prince is clearly a democrat,” remarked Aglaya.
__label__di “Well, if you could tell Aleksey about it, surely you can tell us too.”
__label__di “I do so want to hear about it,” repeated Adelaida.
__label__di “Just now, I confess,” began the prince, with more animation, “when you asked me for a subject for a picture, I confess I had serious thoughts of giving you one. I thought of asking you to draw the face of a criminal, one minute before the fall of the guillotine, while the wretched man is still standing on the scaffold, preparatory to placing his neck on the block.”
__label__di “What, his face? only his face?” asked Adelaida. “That would be a strange subject indeed. And what sort of a picture would that make?”
__label__di “Oh, why not?” the prince insisted, with some warmth. “When I was in Basle I saw a picture very much in that style--I should like to tell you about it; I will some time or other; it struck me very forcibly.”
__label__di “Oh, you shall tell us about the Basle picture another time; now we must have all about the execution,” said Adelaida. “Tell us about that face as it appeared to your imagination--how should it be drawn?--just the face alone, do you mean?”
__label__di “It was just a minute before the execution,” began the prince, readily, carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything else in a moment; “just at the instant when he stepped off the ladder on to the scaffold. He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes and understood all, at once--but how am I to describe it? I do so wish you or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible. I thought at the time what a picture it would make. You must imagine all that went before, of course, all--all. He had lived in the prison for some time and had not expected that the execution would take place for at least a week yet--he had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time; but it so happened that his papers had been got ready quickly. At five o’clock in the morning he was asleep--it was October, and at five in the morning it was cold and dark. The governor of the prison comes in on tip-toe and touches the sleeping man’s shoulder gently. He starts up. ‘What is it?’ he says. ‘The execution is fixed for ten o’clock.’ He was only just awake, and would not believe at first, but began to argue that his papers would not be out for a week, and so on. When he was wide awake and realized the truth, he became very silent and argued no more--so they say; but after a bit he said: ‘It comes very hard on one so suddenly’ and then he was silent again and said nothing.
__label__di “The three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary preparations--the priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some wine they gave him; doesn’t it seem ridiculous?) And yet I believe these people give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart, and believe that they are doing a good action. Then he is dressed, and then begins the procession through the town to the scaffold. I think he, too, must feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along. Probably he thought, on the way, ‘Oh, I have a long, long time yet. Three streets of life yet! When we’ve passed this street there’ll be that other one; and then that one where the baker’s shop is on the right; and when shall we get there? It’s ages, ages!’ Around him are crowds shouting, yelling--ten thousand faces, twenty thousand eyes. All this has to be endured, and especially the thought: ‘Here are ten thousand men, and not one of them is going to be executed, and yet I am to die.’ Well, all that is preparatory.
__label__di “At the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst into tears--and this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say! There was a priest with him the whole time, talking; even in the cart as they drove along, he talked and talked. Probably the other heard nothing; he would begin to listen now and then, and at the third word or so he had forgotten all about it.
__label__di “At last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so that he had to take very small steps. The priest, who seemed to be a wise man, had stopped talking now, and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to kiss. At the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough; but when he set foot on the scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became the colour of paper, positively like white notepaper. His legs must have become suddenly feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his throat--you know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear, when one does not lose one’s wits, but is absolutely powerless to move? If some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen; if a house were just about to fall on one;--don’t you know how one would long to sit down and shut one’s eyes and wait, and wait? Well, when this terrible feeling came over him, the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips, without a word--a little silver cross it was--and he kept on pressing it to the man’s lips every second. And whenever the cross touched his lips, the eyes would open for a moment, and the legs moved once, and he kissed the cross greedily, hurriedly--just as though he were anxious to catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards, though he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the time. And so up to the very block.
__label__di “How strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment! On the contrary, the brain is especially active, and works incessantly--probably hard, hard, hard--like an engine at full pressure. I imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his head--all unfinished ones, and strange, funny thoughts, very likely!--like this, for instance: ‘That man is looking at me, and he has a wart on his forehead! and the executioner has burst one of his buttons, and the lowest one is all rusty!’ And meanwhile he notices and remembers everything. There is one point that cannot be forgotten, round which everything else dances and turns about; and because of this point he cannot faint, and this lasts until the very final quarter of a second, when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens and waits and _knows_--that’s the point, he _knows_ that he is just _now_ about to die, and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head. If I lay there, I should certainly listen for that grating sound, and hear it, too! There would probably be but the tenth part of an instant left to hear it in, but one would certainly hear it. And imagine, some people declare that when the head flies off it is _conscious_ of having flown off! Just imagine what a thing to realize! Fancy if consciousness were to last for even five seconds!
__label__di “Draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in clearly. The criminal must be just stepping on to it, his face as white as note-paper. The priest is holding the cross to his blue lips, and the criminal kisses it, and knows and sees and understands everything. The cross and the head--there’s your picture; the priest and the executioner, with his two assistants, and a few heads and eyes below. Those might come in as subordinate accessories--a sort of mist. There’s a picture for you.” The prince paused, and looked around.
__label__di “Certainly that isn’t much like quietism,” murmured Alexandra, half to herself.
__label__di “Now tell us about your love affairs,” said Adelaida, after a moment’s pause.
__label__di The prince gazed at her in amazement.
__label__di “You know,” Adelaida continued, “you owe us a description of the Basle picture; but first I wish to hear how you fell in love. Don’t deny the fact, for you did, of course. Besides, you stop philosophizing when you are telling about anything.”
__label__di “Why are you ashamed of your stories the moment after you have told them?” asked Aglaya, suddenly.
__label__di “How silly you are!” said Mrs. Epanchin, looking indignantly towards the last speaker.
__label__di “Yes, that wasn’t a clever remark,” said Alexandra.
__label__di “Don’t listen to her, prince,” said Mrs. Epanchin; “she says that sort of thing out of mischief. Don’t think anything of their nonsense, it means nothing. They love to chaff, but they like you. I can see it in their faces--I know their faces.”
__label__di “I know their faces, too,” said the prince, with a peculiar stress on the words.
__label__di “How so?” asked Adelaida, with curiosity.
__label__di “What do _you_ know about our faces?” exclaimed the other two, in chorus.
__label__di But the prince was silent and serious. All awaited his reply.
__label__di “I’ll tell you afterwards,” he said quietly.
__label__di “Ah, you want to arouse our curiosity!” said Aglaya. “And how terribly solemn you are about it!”
__label__di “Very well,” interrupted Adelaida, “then if you can read faces so well, you _must_ have been in love. Come now; I’ve guessed--let’s have the secret!”
__label__di “I have not been in love,” said the prince, as quietly and seriously as before. “I have been happy in another way.”
__label__di “How, how?”
__label__di “Well, I’ll tell you,” said the prince, apparently in a deep reverie.
__label__di VI.
__label__di “Here you all are,” began the prince, “settling yourselves down to listen to me with so much curiosity, that if I do not satisfy you you will probably be angry with me. No, no! I’m only joking!” he added, hastily, with a smile.
__label__di “Well, then--they were all children there, and I was always among children and only with children. They were the children of the village in which I lived, and they went to the school there--all of them. I did not teach them, oh no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut. I may have taught them some things, but I was among them just as an outsider, and I passed all four years of my life there among them. I wished for nothing better; I used to tell them everything and hid nothing from them. Their fathers and relations were very angry with me, because the children could do nothing without me at last, and used to throng after me at all times. The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end! I had many enemies, and all because of the children. Even Schneider reproached me. What were they afraid of? One can tell a child everything, anything. I have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little. They should not conceal so much from them. How well even little children understand that their parents conceal things from them, because they consider them too young to understand! Children are capable of giving advice in the most important matters. How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly? I call them birds because there is nothing in the world better than birds!
__label__di “However, most of the people were angry with me about one and the same thing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of me. At first he had wagged his head and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told them so well, and could not learn from him; and he laughed like anything when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very much, but that _they_ might teach us a good deal.
__label__di “How he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me, living among children as he did, is what I cannot understand. Children soothe and heal the wounded heart. I remember there was one poor fellow at our professor’s who was being treated for madness, and you have no idea what those children did for him, eventually. I don’t think he was mad, but only terribly unhappy. But I’ll tell you all about him another day. Now I must get on with this story.
__label__di “The children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly, awkward kind of a fellow then--and I know I am ugly. Besides, I was a foreigner. The children used to laugh at me, at first; and they even went so far as to throw stones at me, when they saw me kiss Marie. I only kissed her once in my life--no, no, don’t laugh!” The prince hastened to suppress the smiles of his audience at this point. “It was not a matter of _love_ at all! If only you knew what a miserable creature she was, you would have pitied her, just as I did. She belonged to our village. Her mother was an old, old woman, and they used to sell string and thread, and soap and tobacco, out of the window of their little house, and lived on the pittance they gained by this trade. The old woman was ill and very old, and could hardly move. Marie was her daughter, a girl of twenty, weak and thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work at the houses around, day by day. Well, one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and carried her off; and a week later he deserted her. She came home dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had walked for a whole week without shoes; she had slept in the fields, and caught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen and sore, and her hands torn and scratched all over. She never had been pretty even before; but her eyes were quiet, innocent, kind eyes.
__label__di “She was very quiet always--and I remember once, when she had suddenly begun singing at her work, everyone said, ‘Marie tried to sing today!’ and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after. She had been treated kindly in the place before; but when she came back now--ill and shunned and miserable--not one of them all had the slightest sympathy for her. Cruel people! Oh, what hazy understandings they have on such matters! Her mother was the first to show the way. She received her wrathfully, unkindly, and with contempt. ‘You have disgraced me,’ she said. She was the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all heard that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see her and crowded into the little cottage--old men, children, women, girls--such a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd. Marie was lying on the floor at the old woman’s feet, hungry, torn, draggled, crying, miserable.
__label__di “When everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her dishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor. Everyone looked at her as though she were a piece of dirt off the road. The old men scolded and condemned, and the young ones laughed at her. The women condemned her too, and looked at her contemptuously, just as though she were some loathsome insect.
__label__di “Her mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her head and encouraged them. The old woman was very ill at that time, and knew she was dying (she really did die a couple of months later), and though she felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter, to the very day of her death. She would not even speak to her. She made her sleep on straw in a shed, and hardly gave her food enough to support life.
__label__di “Marie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and did everything for her; but the old woman accepted all her services without a word and never showed her the slightest kindness. Marie bore all this; and I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite right and fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures.
__label__di Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine o’clock one morning, a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching the latter city at full speed.
__label__di The morning was so damp and misty that it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking; and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage windows.
__label__di Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at the different stations nearer town.
__label__di All of them seemed weary, and most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside.
__label__di When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages found themselves opposite each other.
__label__di Both were young fellows, both were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation.
__label__di If they had but known why, at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw Railway Company.
__label__di One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes.
__label__di His nose was broad and flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent, ironical--it might almost be called a malicious--smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face.
__label__di A special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen, self-satisfied bearing.
__label__di He wore a large fur--or rather astrachan--overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared.
__label__di His wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it--the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North Italy--was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.
__label__di The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very fair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence, of an epileptic subject.
__label__di His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold.
__label__di He held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very un-Russian.
__label__di His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having nothing better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:  “Cold?”  “Very,” said his neighbour, readily, “and this is a thaw, too.
__label__di Fancy if it had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the old country.
__label__di I’ve grown quite out of the way of it.”  “What, been abroad, I suppose?”  “Yes, straight from Switzerland.”  “Wheugh! my goodness!” The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then laughed.
__label__di The conversation proceeded.
__label__di The readiness of the fair-haired young man in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour’s questions was surprising.
__label__di He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him.
__label__di Replying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had been long absent from Russia, more than four years; that he had been sent abroad for his health; that he had suffered from some strange nervous malady--a kind of epilepsy, with convulsive spasms.
__label__di His interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and more than ever, when to the question, “whether he had been cured?” the patient replied:  “No, they did not cure me.”  “Hey! that’s it! You stumped up your money for nothing, and we believe in those fellows, here!” remarked the black-haired individual, sarcastically.
__label__di “Gospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!” exclaimed another passenger, a shabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face.
__label__di “Gospel truth! All they do is to get hold of our good Russian money free, gratis, and for nothing.”  “Oh, but you’re quite wrong in my particular instance,” said the Swiss patient, quietly.
__label__di “Of course I can’t argue the matter, because I know only my own case; but my doctor gave me money--and he had very little--to pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while there, for nearly two years.”  “Why? Was there no one else to pay for you?” asked the black-haired one.
__label__di “No--Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple of years ago.
__label__di I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a distant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter.
__label__di And so eventually I came back.”  “And where have you come to?”  “That is--where am I going to stay? I--I really don’t quite know yet, I--”  Both the listeners laughed again.
__label__di “I suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?” asked the first.
__label__di “I bet anything it is!” exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with extreme satisfaction, “and that he has precious little in the luggage van!--though of course poverty is no crime--we must remember that!”  It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised.
__label__di The young fellow hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness.
__label__di “Your bundle has some importance, however,” continued the clerk, when they had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of their mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); “for though I dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d’or and louis d’or--judge from your costume and gaiters--still--if you can add to your possessions such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General Epanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at once.
__label__di That is, of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchin’s, and have not made a little error through--well, absence of mind, which is very common to human beings; or, say--through a too luxuriant fancy?”  “Oh, you are right again,” said the fair-haired traveller, “for I really am _almost_ wrong when I say she and I are related.
__label__di She is hardly a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter.
__label__di I expected as much.”  “H’m! you spent your postage for nothing, then.
__label__di H’m! you are candid, however--and that is commendable.
__label__di H’m! Mrs. Epanchin--oh yes! a most eminent person.
__label__di I know her.
__label__di As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in Switzerland, I know him too--at least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch of that name? A fine fellow he was--and had a property of four thousand souls in his day.”  “Yes, Nicolai Andreevitch--that was his name,” and the young fellow looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with the red nose.
__label__di This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class.
__label__di They are people who know everyone--that is, they know where a man is employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what money his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc.
__label__di These men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and they spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of knowledge, which they reduce--or raise--to the standard of a science.
__label__di During the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man had become very impatient.
__label__di He stared out of the window, and fidgeted, and evidently longed for the end of the journey.
__label__di He was very absent; he would appear to listen--and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a sudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.
__label__di “Excuse me,” said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle, rather suddenly; “whom have I the honour to be talking to?”  “Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,” replied the latter, with perfect readiness.
__label__di “Prince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? H’m! I don’t know, I’m sure! I may say I have never heard of such a person,” said the clerk, thoughtfully.
__label__di “At least, the name, I admit, is historical.
__label__di Karamsin must mention the family name, of course, in his history--but as an individual--one never hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.”  “Of course not,” replied the prince; “there are none, except myself.
__label__di I believe I am the last and only one.
__label__di As to my forefathers, they have always been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army.
__label__di I don’t know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she is descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her line.”  “And did you learn science and all that, with your professor over there?” asked the black-haired passenger.
__label__di “Oh yes--I did learn a little, but--”  “I’ve never learned anything whatever,” said the other.
__label__di “Oh, but I learned very little, you know!” added the prince, as though excusing himself.
__label__di “They could not teach me very much on account of my illness.”  “Do you know the Rogojins?” asked his questioner, abruptly.
__label__di “No, I don’t--not at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia.
__label__di Why, is that your name?”  “Yes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.”  “Parfen Rogojin? dear me--then don’t you belong to those very Rogojins, perhaps--” began the clerk, with a very perceptible increase of civility in his tone.
__label__di “Yes--those very ones,” interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with scant courtesy.
__label__di I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the blotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks direct to the prince.
__label__di “Dear me--is it possible?” observed the clerk, while his face assumed an expression of great deference and servility--if not of absolute alarm: “what, a son of that very Semen Rogojin--hereditary honourable citizen--who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of roubles?”  “And how do _you_ know that he left two million and a half of roubles?”  asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and not deigning so much as to look at the other.
__label__di “However, it’s true enough that my father died a month ago, and that here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot to my foot.
__label__di They’ve treated me like a dog! I’ve been ill of fever at Pskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I received from my mother or my confounded brother!”  “And now you’ll have a million roubles, at least--goodness gracious me!”  exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.
__label__di “Five weeks since, I was just like yourself,” continued Rogojin, addressing the prince, “with nothing but a bundle and the clothes I wore.
__label__di I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my aunt’s house, where I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was away.
__label__di All honour to my respected father’s memory--but he uncommonly nearly killed me, all the same.
__label__di Give you my word, prince, if I hadn’t cut and run then, when I did, he’d have murdered me like a dog.”  “I suppose you angered him somehow?” asked the prince, looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity.
__label__di But though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that.
__label__di Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as safety-valve to his agitation.
__label__di As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latter--since the information as to the identity of Rogojin--hung over him, seemed to be living on the honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every syllable as though it were a pearl of great price.
__label__di “Oh, yes; I angered him--I certainly did anger him,” replied Rogojin.
__label__di “But what puts me out so is my brother.
__label__di Of course my mother couldn’t do anything--she’s too old--and whatever brother Senka says is law for her! But why couldn’t he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say.
__label__di What’s the good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it back to the office unopened, and there it’s been ever since! It’s only thanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it.
__label__di He says my brother cut off the gold tassels from my father’s coffin, at night ‘because they’re worth a lot of money!’ says he.
__label__di Why, I can get him sent off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; it’s sacrilege.
__label__di Here, you--scarecrow!” he added, addressing the clerk at his side, “is it sacrilege or not, by law?”  “Sacrilege, certainly--certainly sacrilege,” said the latter.
__label__di “And it’s Siberia for sacrilege, isn’t it?”  “Undoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!”  “They will think that I’m still ill,” continued Rogojin to the prince, “but I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came away.
__label__di Aha, brother Senka, you’ll have to open your gates and let me in, my boy! I know he told tales about me to my father--I know that well enough but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna that’s very sure, and that was my own doing.”  “Nastasia Philipovna?” said the clerk, as though trying to think out something.
__label__di “Come, you know nothing about _her_,” said Rogojin, impatiently.
__label__di “And supposing I do know something?” observed the other, triumphantly.
__label__di “Bosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas.
__label__di And what an impertinent beast you are!” he added angrily.
__label__di “I thought some creature like you would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money.”  “Oh, but I do know, as it happens,” said the clerk in an aggravating manner.
__label__di “Lebedeff knows all about her.
__label__di You are pleased to reproach me, your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all? Nastasia Phillpovna’s family name is Barashkoff--I know, you see--and she is a very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too.
__label__di She is connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable property, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of General Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is.”  “My eyes!” said Rogojin, really surprised at last.
__label__di “The devil take the fellow, how does he know that?”  “Why, he knows everything--Lebedeff knows everything! I was a month or two with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he was knocking about--he’s in the debtor’s prison now--I was with him, and he couldn’t do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia Philipovna and several people at that time.”  “Nastasia Philipovna? Why, you don’t mean to say that she and Lihachof--” cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.
__label__di “No, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!” said Lebedeff, hastily.
__label__di “Oh dear no, not for the world! Totski’s the only man with any chance there.
__label__di Oh, no! He takes her to his box at the opera at the French theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at her and say, ‘By Jove, there’s the famous Nastasia Philipovna!’ but no one ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.”  “Yes, it’s quite true,” said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; “so Zaleshoff told me.
__label__di I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my father’s old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped into her carriage.
__label__di I swear I was all of a blaze at once.
__label__di Then I met Zaleshoff--looking like a hair-dresser’s assistant, got up as fine as I don’t know who, while I looked like a tinker.
__label__di ‘Don’t flatter yourself, my boy,’ said he; ‘she’s not for such as you; she’s a princess, she is, and her name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with Totski, who wishes to get rid of her because he’s growing rather old--fifty-five or so--and wants to marry a certain beauty, the loveliest woman in all Petersburg.’ And then he told me that I could see Nastasia Philipovna at the opera-house that evening, if I liked, and described which was her box.
__label__di Well, I’d like to see my father allowing any of us to go to the theatre; he’d sooner have killed us, any day.
__label__di However, I went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and I never slept a wink all night after.
__label__di Next morning my father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand roubles each.
__label__di ‘Sell them,’ said he, ‘and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.’ Well, I sold the bonds, but I didn’t take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went straight to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond the size of a nut in each.
__label__di They cost four hundred roubles more than I had, so I gave my name, and they trusted me.
__label__di With the earrings I went at once to Zaleshoff’s.
__label__di ‘Come on!’ I said, ‘come on to Nastasia Philipovna’s,’ and off we went without more ado.
__label__di I tell you I hadn’t a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way; I saw nothing whatever.
__label__di We went straight into her drawing-room, and then she came out to us.
__label__di “I didn’t say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: ‘From Parfen Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind as to accept these!’  “She opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed.
__label__di “‘Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,’ says she, and bowed and went off.
__label__di Why didn’t I die there on the spot? The worst of it all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I was short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and never said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all in the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing and scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!  “‘Look here now,’ I said, when we came out, ‘none of your interference here after this--do you understand?’ He laughed: ‘And how are you going to settle up with your father?’ says he.
__label__di I thought I might as well jump into the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I wouldn’t, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.”  “My goodness!” shivered the clerk.
__label__di “And his father,” he added, for the prince’s instruction, “and his father would have given a man a ticket to the other world for ten roubles any day--not to speak of ten thousand!”  The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than ever at this moment.
__label__di “What do you know about it?” cried the latter.
__label__di “Well, my father learned the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town besides.
__label__di So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for an hour.
__label__di ‘This is only a foretaste,’ says he; ‘wait a bit till night comes, and I’ll come back and talk to you again.’  “Well, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds.
__label__di So after awhile she brought the box and flew out at him.
__label__di ‘There,’ she says, ‘take your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten times dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have cost Parfen to get them! Give Parfen my compliments,’ she says, ‘and thank him very much!’ Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five roubles from a friend, and off I went to Pskoff to my aunt’s.
__label__di The old woman there lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking tour round the public-houses of the place.
__label__di I was in a high fever when I got to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets somewhere or other!”  “Oho! we’ll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!” giggled Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee.
__label__di “Hey, my boy, we’ll get her some proper earrings now! We’ll get her such earrings that--”  “Look here,” cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, “look here, if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, I’ll tan your hide as sure as you sit there!”  “Aha! do--by all means! if you tan my hide you won’t turn me away from your society.
__label__di You’ll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever.
__label__di Ha, ha! here we are at the station, though.”  Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.
__label__di Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with profuse waving of hats and shouting.
__label__di “Why, there’s Zaleshoff here, too!” he muttered, gazing at the scene with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile.
__label__di Then he suddenly turned to the prince: “Prince, I don’t know why I have taken a fancy to you; perhaps because I met you just when I did.
__label__di But no, it can’t be that, for I met this fellow” (nodding at Lebedeff) “too, and I have not taken a fancy to him by any means.
__label__di Come to see me, prince; we’ll take off those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best we can buy.
__label__di You shall have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat, anything you like, and your pocket shall be full of money.
__label__di Come, and you shall go with me to Nastasia Philipovna’s.
__label__di Now then will you come or no?”  “Accept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch” said Lebedef solemnly; “don’t let it slip! Accept, quick!”  Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he replied with some cordiality:  “I will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for taking a fancy to me.
__label__di I dare say I may even come today if I have time, for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too.
__label__di I liked you especially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you before that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face.
__label__di Thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon.
__label__di As for money, I have hardly a copeck about me at this moment.”  “You shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so come along!”  “That’s true enough, he’ll have lots before evening!” put in Lebedeff.
__label__di “But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies? Let’s know that first?” asked Rogojin.
__label__di “Oh no, oh no!” said the prince; “I couldn’t, you know--my illness--I hardly ever saw a soul.”  “H’m! well--here, you fellow--you can come along with me now if you like!” cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage.
__label__di Lebedeff had his desire.
__label__di He went off with the noisy group of Rogojin’s friends towards the Voznesensky, while the prince’s route lay towards the Litaynaya.
__label__di It was damp and wet.
__label__di The prince asked his way of passers-by, and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination, he determined to take a droshky.
__label__di II.
__label__di General Epanchin lived in his own house near the Litaynaya.
__label__di Besides this large residence--five-sixths of which was let in flats and lodgings--the general was owner of another enormous house in the Sadovaya bringing in even more rent than the first.
__label__di Besides these houses he had a delightful little estate just out of town, and some sort of factory in another part of the city.
__label__di General Epanchin, as everyone knew, had a good deal to do with certain government monopolies; he was also a voice, and an important one, in many rich public companies of various descriptions; in fact, he enjoyed the reputation of being a well-to-do man of busy habits, many ties, and affluent means.
__label__di He had made himself indispensable in several quarters, amongst others in his department of the government; and yet it was a known fact that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of no education whatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks.
__label__di This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own little weaknesses--very excusable ones,--one of which was a dislike to any allusion to the above circumstance.
__label__di He was undoubtedly clever.
__label__di For instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and because “he knew his place.” And yet if these good people could only have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who “knew his place” so well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the world and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to be carrying out other people’s ideas rather than his own.
__label__di And also, his luck seldom failed him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal.
__label__di He played for high stakes, and moved, altogether, in very varied society.
__label__di As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is, about fifty-five years of age,--the flowering time of existence, when real enjoyment of life begins.
__label__di His healthy appearance, good colour, sound, though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during business hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening, all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make existence a bed of roses to his excellency.
__label__di The general was lord of a flourishing family, consisting of his wife and three grown-up daughters.
__label__di He had married young, while still a lieutenant, his wife being a girl of about his own age, who possessed neither beauty nor education, and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed property, which little estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far more important accumulations.
__label__di The general never regretted his early marriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a brilliant, was, at all events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was extremely proud of her descent.
__label__di With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long union very happily.
__label__di While still young the wife had been able to make important friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she took her place among the higher circles as by right.
__label__di During these last few years all three of the general’s daughters--Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya--had grown up and matured.
__label__di Of course they were only Epanchins, but their mother’s family was noble; they might expect considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of attaining to very high rank indeed in his country’s service--all of which was satisfactory.
__label__di All three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even the eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old.
__label__di The middle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty.
__label__di This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society.
__label__di But this was not all, for every one of the three was clever, well educated, and accomplished.
__label__di It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even said that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the idol of the household, Aglaya.
__label__di In society they not only disliked asserting themselves, but were actually retiring.
__label__di Certainly no one could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody was well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own value.
__label__di The eldest was musical, while the second was a clever artist, which fact she had concealed until lately.
__label__di In a word, the world spoke well of the girls; but they were not without their enemies, and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had read.
__label__di They were in no hurry to marry.
__label__di They liked good society, but were not too keen about it.
__label__di All this was the more remarkable, because everyone was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents.
__label__di It was about eleven o’clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the bell at General Epanchin’s door.
__label__di The general lived on the first floor or flat of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted.
__label__di A liveried servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter into long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance, looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion.
__label__di At last, however, on the repeated positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and must absolutely see the general on business, the bewildered domestic showed him into a little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that adjoined the general’s study, there handing him over to another servant, whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the morning, and announce visitors to the general.
__label__di This second individual wore a dress coat, and was some forty years of age; he was the general’s special study servant, and well aware of his own importance.
__label__di “Wait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here,” said the door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the ante-chamber.
__label__di He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his knees.
__label__di “If you don’t mind, I would rather sit here with you,” said the prince; “I should prefer it to sitting in there.”  “Oh, but you can’t stay here.
__label__di You are a visitor--a guest, so to speak.
__label__di Is it the general himself you wish to see?”  The man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby-looking visitor, and had decided to ask once more.
__label__di “Yes--I have business--” began the prince.
__label__di “I do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to do is to announce you; and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that.”  The man’s suspicions seemed to increase more and more.
__label__di The prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors; and although the general certainly did receive, on business, all sorts and conditions of men, yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular visitor.
__label__di The presence of the secretary as an intermediary was, he judged, essential in this case.
__label__di “Surely you--are from abroad?” he inquired at last, in a confused sort of way.
__label__di He had begun his sentence intending to say, “Surely you are not Prince Muishkin, are you?”  “Yes, straight from the train! Did not you intend to say, ‘Surely you are not Prince Muishkin?’ just now, but refrained out of politeness?”  “H’m!” grunted the astonished servant.
__label__di “I assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have to answer for me.
__label__di As to my being dressed like this, and carrying a bundle, there’s nothing surprising in that--the fact is, my circumstances are not particularly rosy at this moment.”  “H’m!--no, I’m not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you, that’s all.
__label__di The secretary will be out directly--that is, unless you--yes, that’s the rub--unless you--come, you must allow me to ask you--you’ve not come to beg, have you?”  “Oh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score.
__label__di I have quite another matter on hand.”  “You must excuse my asking, you know.
__label__di Your appearance led me to think--but just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the secretary is sure to come out.”  “Oh--well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind telling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke? I have my pipe and tobacco with me.”  “_Smoke?_” said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses.
__label__di “No, sir, you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion.
__label__di Ha, ha! a cool idea that, I declare!”  “Oh, I didn’t mean in this room! I know I can’t smoke here, of course.
__label__di I’d adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to.
__label__di You see, I’m used to smoking a good deal, and now I haven’t had a puff for three hours; however, just as you like.”  “Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?” muttered the servant.
__label__di “In the first place, you’ve no right in here at all; you ought to be in the waiting-room, because you’re a sort of visitor--a guest, in fact--and I shall catch it for this.
__label__di Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?” he added, glancing once more at the prince’s bundle, which evidently gave him no peace.
__label__di “No, I don’t think so.
__label__di I don’t think I should stay even if they were to invite me.
__label__di I’ve simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing more.”  “Make their acquaintance?” asked the man, in amazement, and with redoubled suspicion.
__label__di “Then why did you say you had business with the general?”  “Oh well, very little business.
__label__di There is one little matter--some advice I am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to introduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is the last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there are no other Muishkins left.”  “What--you’re a relation then, are you?” asked the servant, so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.
__label__di “Well, hardly so.
__label__di If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course, but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it.
__label__di I once wrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply.
__label__di However, I have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival.
__label__di I am telling you all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still far from comfortable on my account.
__label__di All you have to do is to announce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be plain enough.
__label__di If I am received--very good; if not, well, very good again.
__label__di But they are sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of her family.
__label__di She values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed.”  The prince’s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree, and the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common serving-man this state of things was highly improper.
__label__di His conclusion was that one of two things must be the explanation--either that this was a begging impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a fool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any ambition would certainly not wait about in ante-rooms with servants, and talk of his own private affairs like this.
__label__di In either case, how was he to announce this singular visitor?  “I really think I must request you to step into the next room!” he said, with all the insistence he could muster.
__label__di “Why? If I had been sitting there now, I should not have had the opportunity of making these personal explanations.
__label__di I see you are still uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle.
__label__di Don’t you think you might go in yourself now, without waiting for the secretary to come out?”  “No, no! I can’t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary.
__label__di Besides the general said he was not to be disturbed--he is with the Colonel C--.
__label__di Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without announcing.”  “Who may that be? a clerk?”  “What? Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Oh no; he belongs to one of the companies.
__label__di Look here, at all events put your bundle down, here.”  “Yes, I will if I may; and--can I take off my cloak”  “Of course; you can’t go in _there_ with it on, anyhow.”  The prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat enough morning costume--a little worn, but well made.
__label__di He wore a steel watch chain and from this chain there hung a silver Geneva watch.
__label__di Fool the prince might be, still, the general’s servant felt that it was not correct for him to continue to converse thus with a visitor, in spite of the fact that the prince pleased him somehow.
__label__di “And what time of day does the lady receive?” the latter asked, reseating himself in his old place.
__label__di “Oh, that’s not in _my_ province! I believe she receives at any time; it depends upon the visitors.
__label__di The dressmaker goes in at eleven.
__label__di Gavrila Ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people, too; he is even admitted to early lunch now and then.”  “It is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season,”  observed the prince; “but it is much warmer there out of doors.
__label__di As for the houses--a Russian can’t live in them in the winter until he gets accustomed to them.”  “Don’t they heat them at all?”  “Well, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves are so different to ours.”  “H’m! were you long away?”  “Four years! and I was in the same place nearly all the time,--in one village.”  “You must have forgotten Russia, hadn’t you?”  “Yes, indeed I had--a good deal; and, would you believe it, I often wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak Russian? Even now, as I talk to you, I keep saying to myself ‘how well I am speaking it.’ Perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning.
__label__di I assure you, ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go on and on talking Russian.”  “H’m! yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?”  This good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples, really could not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation.
__label__di “In Petersburg? Oh no! hardly at all, and now they say so much is changed in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to relearn what they knew.
__label__di They talk a good deal about the new law courts, and changes there, don’t they?”  “H’m! yes, that’s true enough.
__label__di Well now, how is the law over there, do they administer it more justly than here?”  “Oh, I don’t know about that! I’ve heard much that is good about our legal administration, too.
__label__di There is no capital punishment here for one thing.”  “Is there over there?”  “Yes--I saw an execution in France--at Lyons.
__label__di Schneider took me over with him to see it.”  “What, did they hang the fellow?”  “No, they cut off people’s heads in France.”  “What did the fellow do?--yell?”  “Oh no--it’s the work of an instant.
__label__di They put a man inside a frame and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery--they call the thing a guillotine--it falls with fearful force and weight--the head springs off so quickly that you can’t wink your eye in between.
__label__di But all the preparations are so dreadful.
__label__di When they announce the sentence, you know, and prepare the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to the scaffold--that’s the fearful part of the business.
__label__di The people all crowd round--even women--though they don’t at all approve of women looking on.”  “No, it’s not a thing for women.”  “Of course not--of course not!--bah! The criminal was a fine intelligent fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell you--believe it or not, as you like--that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he _cried_, he did indeed,--he was as white as a bit of paper.
__label__di Isn’t it a dreadful idea that he should have cried--cried! Whoever heard of a grown man crying from fear--not a child, but a man who never had cried before--a grown man of forty-five years.
__label__di Imagine what must have been going on in that man’s mind at such a moment; what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the soul that’s what it is.
__label__di Because it is said ‘thou shalt not kill,’ is he to be killed because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, it’s an impossible theory.
__label__di I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago and it’s dancing before my eyes to this moment.
__label__di I dream of it, often.”  The prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge of colour suffused his pale face, though his way of talking was as quiet as ever.
__label__di The servant followed his words with sympathetic interest.
__label__di Clearly he was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end.
__label__di Who knows? Perhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for thought.
__label__di “Well, at all events it is a good thing that there’s no pain when the poor fellow’s head flies off,” he remarked.
__label__di “Do you know, though,” cried the prince warmly, “you made that remark now, and everyone says the same thing, and the machine is designed with the purpose of avoiding pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought came into my head then: what if it be a bad plan after all? You may laugh at my idea, perhaps--but I could not help its occurring to me all the same.
__label__di Now with the rack and tortures and so on--you suffer terrible pain of course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you have plenty of that) until you die.
__label__di But _here_ I should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain at all--but the certain knowledge that in an hour,--then in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now--this very _instant_--your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man--and that this is certain, _certain_! That’s the point--the certainty of it.
__label__di Just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head--then--that quarter of a second is the most awful of all.
__label__di “This is not my own fantastical opinion--many people have thought the same; but I feel it so deeply that I’ll tell you what I think.
__label__di I believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime.
__label__di A murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal.
__label__di The man who is attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death.
__label__di There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy--at all events hoping on in some degree--even after his throat was cut.
__label__di But in the case of an execution, that last hope--having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,--is taken away from the wretch and _certainty_ substituted in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death--which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world.
__label__di You may place a soldier before a cannon’s mouth in battle, and fire upon him--and he will still hope.
__label__di But read to that same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears.
__label__di Who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad? No, no! it is an abuse, a shame, it is unnecessary--why should such a thing exist? Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved; perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards.
__label__di Our Lord Christ spoke of this anguish and dread.
__label__di No! no! no! No man should be treated so, no man, no man!”  The servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this as the prince did, still clearly entered into it and was greatly conciliated, as was evident from the increased amiability of his expression.
__label__di “If you are really very anxious for a smoke,” he remarked, “I think it might possibly be managed, if you are very quick about it.
__label__di You see they might come out and inquire for you, and you wouldn’t be on the spot.
__label__di You see that door there? Go in there and you’ll find a little room on the right; you can smoke there, only open the window, because I ought not to allow it really, and--.” But there was no time, after all.
__label__di A young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment, with a bundle of papers in his hand.
__label__di The footman hastened to help him take off his overcoat.
__label__di The new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his eyes.
__label__di “This gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,” began the man, confidentially and almost familiarly, “that he is Prince Muishkin and a relative of Madame Epanchin’s.
__label__di He has just arrived from abroad, with nothing but a bundle by way of luggage--.”  The prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the servant continued his communication in a whisper.
__label__di Gavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively, and gazed at the prince with great curiosity.
__label__di At last he motioned the man aside and stepped hurriedly towards the prince.
__label__di “Are you Prince Muishkin?” he asked, with the greatest courtesy and amiability.
__label__di He was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty-eight summers, fair and of middle height; he wore a small beard, and his face was most intelligent.
__label__di Yet his smile, in spite of its sweetness, was a little thin, if I may so call it, and showed his teeth too evenly; his gaze though decidedly good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too inquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable.
__label__di “Probably when he is alone he looks quite different, and hardly smiles at all!” thought the prince.
__label__di He explained about himself in a few words, very much the same as he had told the footman and Rogojin beforehand.
__label__di Gavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall something.
__label__di “Was it not you, then, who sent a letter a year or less ago--from Switzerland, I think it was--to Elizabetha Prokofievna (Mrs. Epanchin)?”  “It was.”  “Oh, then, of course they will remember who you are.
__label__di You wish to see the general? I’ll tell him at once--he will be free in a minute; but you--you had better wait in the ante-chamber,--hadn’t you? Why is he here?” he added, severely, to the man.
__label__di “I tell you, sir, he wished it himself!”  At this moment the study door opened, and a military man, with a portfolio under his arm, came out talking loudly, and after bidding good-bye to someone inside, took his departure.
__label__di “You there, Gania?” cried a voice from the study, “come in here, will you?”  Gavrila Ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room hastily.
__label__di A couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice of Gania cried:  “Come in please, prince!”  III.
__label__di General Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was standing in the middle of the room, and gazed with great curiosity at the prince as he entered.
__label__di He even advanced a couple of steps to meet him.
__label__di The prince came forward and introduced himself.
__label__di “Quite so,” replied the general, “and what can I do for you?”  “Oh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your acquaintance.
__label__di I should not like to disturb you.
__label__di I do not know your times and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived.
__label__di I came straight from the station.
__label__di I am come direct from Switzerland.”  The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his smile back.
__label__di Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest once more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat down himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak.
__label__di Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over papers.
__label__di “I have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,” said the general, “but as, of course, you have your object in coming, I--”  “I felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved to pay you this visit,” the prince interrupted; “but I give you my word, beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object whatever.”  “The pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as you are aware.
__label__di There is such a thing as business, and I really do not see what possible reason there can be, or what we have in common to--”  “Oh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is nothing in common between us, or very little; for if I am Prince Muishkin, and your wife happens to be a member of my house, that can hardly be called a ‘reason.’ I quite understand that.
__label__di And yet that was my whole motive for coming.
__label__di You see I have not been in Russia for four years, and knew very little about anything when I left.
__label__di I had been very ill for a long time, and I feel now the need of a few good friends.
__label__di In fact, I have a certain question upon which I much need advice, and do not know whom to go to for it.
__label__di I thought of your family when I was passing through Berlin.
__label__di ‘They are almost relations,’ I said to myself, ‘so I’ll begin with them; perhaps we may get on with each other, I with them and they with me, if they are kind people;’ and I have heard that you are very kind people!”  “Oh, thank you, thank you, I’m sure,” replied the general, considerably taken aback.
__label__di “May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?”  “Nowhere, as yet.”  “What, straight from the station to my house? And how about your luggage?”  “I only had a small bundle, containing linen, with me, nothing more.
__label__di I can carry it in my hand, easily.
__label__di There will be plenty of time to take a room in some hotel by the evening.”  “Oh, then you _do_ intend to take a room?”  “Of course.”  “To judge from your words, you came straight to my house with the intention of staying there.”  “That could only have been on your invitation.
__label__di I confess, however, that I should not have stayed here even if you had invited me, not for any particular reason, but because it is--well, contrary to my practice and nature, somehow.”  “Oh, indeed! Then it is perhaps as well that I neither _did_ invite you, nor _do_ invite you now.
__label__di Excuse me, prince, but we had better make this matter clear, once for all.
__label__di We have just agreed that with regard to our relationship there is not much to be said, though, of course, it would have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship did actually exist; therefore, perhaps--”  “Therefore, perhaps I had better get up and go away?” said the prince, laughing merrily as he rose from his place; just as merrily as though the circumstances were by no means strained or difficult.
__label__di “And I give you my word, general, that though I know nothing whatever of manners and customs of society, and how people live and all that, yet I felt quite sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended now.
__label__di Oh, well, I suppose it’s all right; especially as my letter was not answered.
__label__di Well, good-bye, and forgive me for having disturbed you!”  The prince’s expression was so good-natured at this moment, and so entirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the smile with which he looked at the general as he spoke, that the latter suddenly paused, and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new point of view, all in an instant.
__label__di “Do you know, prince,” he said, in quite a different tone, “I do not know you at all, yet, and after all, Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name.
__label__di Wait a little, if you don’t mind, and if you have time to spare?”  “Oh, I assure you I’ve lots of time, my time is entirely my own!” And the prince immediately replaced his soft, round hat on the table.
__label__di “I confess, I thought Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely remember that I had written her a letter.
__label__di Just now your servant--outside there--was dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you.
__label__di I noticed that! Probably he has very strict instructions on that score; but I assure you I did not come to beg.
__label__di I came to make some friends.
__label__di But I am rather bothered at having disturbed you; that’s all I care about.--”  “Look here, prince,” said the general, with a cordial smile, “if you really are the sort of man you appear to be, it may be a source of great pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance; but, you see, I am a very busy man, and have to be perpetually sitting here and signing papers, or off to see his excellency, or to my department, or somewhere; so that though I should be glad to see more of people, nice people--you see, I--however, I am sure you are so well brought up that you will see at once, and--but how old are you, prince?”  “Twenty-six.”  “No? I thought you very much younger.”  “Yes, they say I have a ‘young’ face.
__label__di As to disturbing you I shall soon learn to avoid doing that, for I hate disturbing people.
__label__di Besides, you and I are so differently constituted, I should think, that there must be very little in common between us.
__label__di Not that I will ever believe there is _nothing_ in common between any two people, as some declare is the case.
__label__di I am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each other into groups, by appearances; but I am boring you, I see, you--”  “Just two words: have you any means at all? Or perhaps you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment? Excuse my questioning you, but--”  “Oh, my dear sir, I esteem and understand your kindness in putting the question.
__label__di No; at present I have no means whatever, and no employment either, but I hope to find some.
__label__di I was living on other people abroad.
__label__di Schneider, the professor who treated me and taught me, too, in Switzerland, gave me just enough money for my journey, so that now I have but a few copecks left.
__label__di There certainly is one question upon which I am anxious to have advice, but--”  “Tell me, how do you intend to live now, and what are your plans?”  interrupted the general.
__label__di “I wish to work, somehow or other.”  “Oh yes, but then, you see, you are a philosopher.
__label__di Have you any talents, or ability in any direction--that is, any that would bring in money and bread? Excuse me again--”  “Oh, don’t apologize.
__label__di No, I don’t think I have either talents or special abilities of any kind; on the contrary.
__label__di I have always been an invalid and unable to learn much.
__label__di As for bread, I should think--”  The general interrupted once more with questions; while the prince again replied with the narrative we have heard before.
__label__di It appeared that the general had known Pavlicheff; but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince, that young gentleman could not explain; probably by virtue of the old friendship with his father, he thought.
__label__di The prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child, and Pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a relative of his own, living in the country, the child needing the fresh air and exercise of country life.
__label__di He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by a tutor, but could not remember much about this time of his life.
__label__di His fits were so frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the prince used the expression “idiot” himself).
__label__di Pavlicheff had met Professor Schneider in Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to Switzerland, to Schneider’s establishment there, for the cure of his epilepsy, and, five years before this time, the prince was sent off.
__label__di But Pavlicheff had died two or three years since, and Schneider had himself supported the young fellow, from that day to this, at his own expense.
__label__di Although he had not quite cured him, he had greatly improved his condition; and now, at last, at the prince’s own desire, and because of a certain matter which came to the ears of the latter, Schneider had despatched the young man to Russia.
__label__di The general was much astonished.
__label__di “Then you have no one, absolutely _no_ one in Russia?” he asked.
__label__di “No one, at present; but I hope to make friends; and then I have a letter from--”  “At all events,” put in the general, not listening to the news about the letter, “at all events, you must have learned _something_, and your malady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work, in one of the departments, for instance?”  “Oh dear no, oh no! As for a situation, I should much like to find one for I am anxious to discover what I really am fit for.
__label__di I have learned a good deal in the last four years, and, besides, I read a great many Russian books.”  “Russian books, indeed? Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?”  “Oh dear, yes!”  “Capital! And your handwriting?”  “Ah, there I am _really_ talented! I may say I am a real caligraphist.
__label__di Let me write you something, just to show you,” said the prince, with some excitement.
__label__di “With pleasure! In fact, it is very necessary.
__label__di I like your readiness, prince; in fact, I must say--I--I--like you very well, altogether,” said the general.
__label__di “What delightful writing materials you have here, such a lot of pencils and things, and what beautiful paper! It’s a charming room altogether.
__label__di I know that picture, it’s a Swiss view.
__label__di I’m sure the artist painted it from nature, and that I have seen the very place--”  “Quite likely, though I bought it here.
__label__di Gania, give the prince some paper.
__label__di Here are pens and paper; now then, take this table.
__label__di What’s this?” the general continued to Gania, who had that moment taken a large photograph out of his portfolio, and shown it to his senior.
__label__di “Halloa! Nastasia Philipovna! Did she send it you herself? Herself?” he inquired, with much curiosity and great animation.
__label__di “She gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate her.
__label__di I asked her for it long ago.
__label__di I don’t know whether she meant it for a hint that I had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,”  added Gania, with an unpleasant smile.
__label__di “Oh, nonsense, nonsense,” said the general, with decision.
__label__di “What extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; that’s not her way at all.
__label__di Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait, however.
__label__di Has she ever asked you for it?”  “No, not yet.
__label__di Very likely she never will.
__label__di I suppose you haven’t forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially invited, you know.”  “Oh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course.
__label__di I should think so! She’s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no.
__label__di So be prepared!”  Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever.
__label__di “Are you sure she said that?” he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver as he spoke.
__label__di “Yes, she promised.
__label__di We both worried her so that she gave in; but she wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.”  The general watched Gania’s confusion intently, and clearly did not like it.
__label__di “Remember, Ivan Fedorovitch,” said Gania, in great agitation, “that I was to be free too, until her decision; and that even then I was to have my ‘yes or no’ free.”  “Why, don’t you, aren’t you--” began the general, in alarm.
__label__di “Oh, don’t misunderstand--”  “But, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?”  “Oh, I’m not rejecting her.
__label__di I may have expressed myself badly, but I didn’t mean that.”  “Reject her! I should think not!” said the general with annoyance, and apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it.
__label__di “Why, my dear fellow, it’s not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you are prepared to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper satisfaction.
__label__di How are things going on at home?”  “At home? Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my father will make a fool of himself, as usual.
__label__di He is rapidly becoming a general nuisance.
__label__di I don’t ever talk to him now, but I hold him in check, safe enough.
__label__di I swear if it had not been for my mother, I should have shown him the way out, long ago.
__label__di My mother is always crying, of course, and my sister sulks.
__label__di I had to tell them at last that I intended to be master of my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home.
__label__di At least, I gave my sister to understand as much, and my mother was present.”  “Well, I must say, I cannot understand it!” said the general, shrugging his shoulders and dropping his hands.
__label__di “You remember your mother, Nina Alexandrovna, that day she came and sat here and groaned--and when I asked her what was the matter, she says, ‘Oh, it’s such a _dishonour_ to us!’ dishonour! Stuff and nonsense! I should like to know who can reproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a word of any kind against her.
__label__di Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski? What nonsense it is! You would not let her come near your daughters, says Nina Alexandrovna.
__label__di What next, I wonder? I don’t see how she can fail to--to understand--”  “Her own position?” prompted Gania.
__label__di “She does understand.
__label__di Don’t be annoyed with her.
__label__di I have warned her not to meddle in other people’s affairs.
__label__di However, although there’s comparative peace at home at present, the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight.”  The prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at the table, writing.
__label__di He finished at last, and brought the result of his labour to the general’s desk.
__label__di “So this is Nastasia Philipovna,” he said, looking attentively and curiously at the portrait.
__label__di “How wonderfully beautiful!” he immediately added, with warmth.
__label__di The picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely woman.
__label__di She was photographed in a black silk dress of simple design, her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were deep and thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, but proud.
__label__di She was rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale.
__label__di Both Gania and the general gazed at the prince in amazement.
__label__di “How do you know it’s Nastasia Philipovna?” asked the general; “you surely don’t know her already, do you?”  “Yes, I do! I have only been one day in Russia, but I have heard of the great beauty!” And the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with Rogojin in the train and the whole of the latter’s story.
__label__di “There’s news!” said the general in some excitement, after listening to the story with engrossed attention.
__label__di “Oh, of course it’s nothing but humbug!” cried Gania, a little disturbed, however.
__label__di “It’s all humbug; the young merchant was pleased to indulge in a little innocent recreation! I have heard something of Rogojin!”  “Yes, so have I!” replied the general.
__label__di “Nastasia Philipovna told us all about the earrings that very day.
__label__di But now it is quite a different matter.
__label__di You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is passionately in love.
__label__di The whole story smells of passion, and we all know what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated.
__label__di I am much afraid of some disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!”  “You are afraid of the million, I suppose,” said Gania, grinning and showing his teeth.
__label__di “And you are _not_, I presume, eh?”  “How did he strike you, prince?” asked Gania, suddenly.
__label__di “Did he seem to be a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow? What was your own opinion about the matter?”  While Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly flashed into his brain, and blazed out, impatiently, in his eyes.
__label__di The general, who was really agitated and disturbed, looked at the prince too, but did not seem to expect much from his reply.
__label__di “I really don’t quite know how to tell you,” replied the prince, “but it certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion, and not, perhaps, quite healthy passion.
__label__di He seemed to be still far from well.
__label__di Very likely he will be in bed again in a day or two, especially if he lives fast.”  “No! do you think so?” said the general, catching at the idea.
__label__di “Yes, I do think so!”  “Yes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment.
__label__di It may be this very evening,” remarked Gania to the general, with a smile.
__label__di “Of course; quite so.
__label__di In that case it all depends upon what is going on in her brain at this moment.”  “You know the kind of person she is at times.”  “How? What kind of person is she?” cried the general, arrived at the limits of his patience.
__label__di “Look here, Gania, don’t you go annoying her tonight.
__label__di What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you can.
__label__di Well, what are you smiling at? You must understand, Gania, that I have no interest whatever in speaking like this.
__label__di Whichever way the question is settled, it will be to my advantage.
__label__di Nothing will move Totski from his resolution, so I run no risk.
__label__di If there is anything I desire, you must know that it is your benefit only.
__label__di Can’t you trust me? You are a sensible fellow, and I have been counting on you; for, in this matter, that, that--”  “Yes, that’s the chief thing,” said Gania, helping the general out of his difficulties again, and curling his lips in an envenomed smile, which he did not attempt to conceal.
__label__di He gazed with his fevered eyes straight into those of the general, as though he were anxious that the latter might read his thoughts.
__label__di The general grew purple with anger.
__label__di “Yes, of course it is the chief thing!” he cried, looking sharply at Gania.
__label__di “What a very curious man you are, Gania! You actually seem to be _glad_ to hear of this millionaire fellow’s arrival--just as though you wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing.
__label__di This is an affair in which you ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due warning, to avoid compromising others.
__label__di But, even now, there is still time.
__label__di Do you understand me? I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not? If not, say so,--and--and welcome! No one is trying to force you into the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if you see a snare in the matter, at least.”  “I do desire it,” murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes; and he relapsed into gloomy silence.
__label__di The general was satisfied.
__label__di He had excited himself, and was evidently now regretting that he had gone so far.
__label__di He turned to the prince, and suddenly the disagreeable thought of the latter’s presence struck him, and the certainty that he must have heard every word of the conversation.
__label__di But he felt at ease in another moment; it only needed one glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear.
__label__di “Oh!” cried the general, catching sight of the prince’s specimen of caligraphy, which the latter had now handed him for inspection.
__label__di “Why, this is simply beautiful; look at that, Gania, there’s real talent there!”  On a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written in medieval characters the legend:  “The gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.”  “There,” explained the prince, with great delight and animation, “there, that’s the abbot’s real signature--from a manuscript of the fourteenth century.
__label__di All these old abbots and bishops used to write most beautifully, with such taste and so much care and diligence.
__label__di Have you no copy of Pogodin, general? If you had one I could show you another type.
__label__di Stop a bit--here you have the large round writing common in France during the eighteenth century.
__label__di Some of the letters are shaped quite differently from those now in use.
__label__di It was the writing current then, and employed by public writers generally.
__label__di I copied this from one of them, and you can see how good it is.
__label__di Look at the well-rounded a and d.
__label__di I have tried to translate the French character into the Russian letters--a difficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly.
__label__di Here is a fine sentence, written in a good, original hand--‘Zeal triumphs over all.’ That is the script of the Russian War Office.
__label__di That is how official documents addressed to important personages should be written.
__label__di The letters are round, the type black, and the style somewhat remarkable.
__label__di A stylist would not allow these ornaments, or attempts at flourishes--just look at these unfinished tails!--but it has distinction and really depicts the soul of the writer.
__label__di He would like to give play to his imagination, and follow the inspiration of his genius, but a soldier is only at ease in the guard-room, and the pen stops half-way, a slave to discipline.
__label__di How delightful! The first time I met an example of this handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you think I chanced to find it? In Switzerland, of all places! Now that is an ordinary English hand.
__label__di It can hardly be improved, it is so refined and exquisite--almost perfection.
__label__di This is an example of another kind, a mixture of styles.
__label__di The copy was given me by a French commercial traveller.
__label__di It is founded on the English, but the downstrokes are a little blacker, and more marked.
__label__di Notice that the oval has some slight modification--it is more rounded.
__label__di This writing allows for flourishes; now a flourish is a dangerous thing! Its use requires such taste, but, if successful, what a distinction it gives to the whole! It results in an incomparable type--one to fall in love with!”  “Dear me! How you have gone into all the refinements and details of the question! Why, my dear fellow, you are not a caligraphist, you are an artist! Eh, Gania?”  “Wonderful!” said Gania.
__label__di “And he knows it too,” he added, with a sarcastic smile.
__label__di “You may smile,--but there’s a career in this,” said the general.
__label__di “You don’t know what a great personage I shall show this to, prince.
__label__di Why, you can command a situation at thirty-five roubles per month to start with.
__label__di However, it’s half-past twelve,” he concluded, looking at his watch; “so to business, prince, for I must be setting to work and shall not see you again today.
__label__di Sit down a minute.
__label__di I have told you that I cannot receive you myself very often, but I should like to be of some assistance to you, some small assistance, of a kind that would give you satisfaction.
__label__di I shall find you a place in one of the State departments, an easy place--but you will require to be accurate.
__label__di Now, as to your plans--in the house, or rather in the family of Gania here--my young friend, whom I hope you will know better--his mother and sister have prepared two or three rooms for lodgers, and let them to highly recommended young fellows, with board and attendance.
__label__di I am sure Nina Alexandrovna will take you in on my recommendation.
__label__di There you will be comfortable and well taken care of; for I do not think, prince, that you are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of Fate in a town like Petersburg.
__label__di Nina Alexandrovna, Gania’s mother, and Varvara Alexandrovna, are ladies for whom I have the highest possible esteem and respect.
__label__di Nina Alexandrovna is the wife of General Ardalion Alexandrovitch, my old brother in arms, with whom, I regret to say, on account of certain circumstances, I am no longer acquainted.
__label__di I give you all this information, prince, in order to make it clear to you that I am personally recommending you to this family, and that in so doing, I am more or less taking upon myself to answer for you.
__label__di The terms are most reasonable, and I trust that your salary will very shortly prove amply sufficient for your expenditure.
__label__di Of course pocket-money is a necessity, if only a little; do not be angry, prince, if I strongly recommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket.
__label__di But as your purse is quite empty at the present moment, you must allow me to press these twenty-five roubles upon your acceptance, as something to begin with.
__label__di Of course we will settle this little matter another time, and if you are the upright, honest man you look, I anticipate very little trouble between us on that score.
__label__di Taking so much interest in you as you may perceive I do, I am not without my object, and you shall know it in good time.
__label__di You see, I am perfectly candid with you.
__label__di I hope, Gania, you have nothing to say against the prince’s taking up his abode in your house?”  “Oh, on the contrary! my mother will be very glad,” said Gania, courteously and kindly.
__label__di “I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not? That fellow Ferd-Ferd--”  “Ferdishenko.”  “Yes--I don’t like that Ferdishenko.
__label__di I can’t understand why Nastasia Philipovna encourages him so.
__label__di Is he really her cousin, as he says?”  “Oh dear no, it’s all a joke.
__label__di No more cousin than I am.”  “Well, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?”  “Thank you, general; you have behaved very kindly to me; all the more so since I did not ask you to help me.
__label__di I don’t say that out of pride.
__label__di I certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight.
__label__di Rogojin asked me to come to his house, of course, but--”  “Rogojin? No, no, my good fellow.
__label__di I should strongly recommend you, paternally,--or, if you prefer it, as a friend,--to forget all about Rogojin, and, in fact, to stick to the family into which you are about to enter.”  “Thank you,” began the prince; “and since you are so very kind there is just one matter which I--”  “You must really excuse me,” interrupted the general, “but I positively haven’t another moment now.
__label__di I shall just tell Elizabetha Prokofievna about you, and if she wishes to receive you at once--as I shall advise her--I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in many ways.
__label__di If she cannot receive you now, you must be content to wait till another time.
__label__di Meanwhile you, Gania, just look over these accounts, will you? We mustn’t forget to finish off that matter--”  The general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching the business which he had on hand, though he had endeavoured to do so four times.
__label__di Gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince.
__label__di The latter accepted the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to disturb Gania’s work.
__label__di He commenced to examine the study and its contents.
__label__di But Gania hardly so much as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was absent and thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together.
__label__di Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over Nastasia Philipovna’s portrait, gazing at it.
__label__di “Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?” he asked, looking intently at him.
__label__di He seemed to have some special object in the question.
__label__di “It’s a wonderful face,” said the prince, “and I feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one.
__label__di Her face is smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly--hasn’t she? Her eyes show it--those two bones there, the little points under her eyes, just where the cheek begins.
__label__di It’s a proud face too, terribly proud! And I--I can’t say whether she is good and kind, or not.
__label__di Oh, if she be but good! That would make all well!”  “And would you marry a woman like that, now?” continued Gania, never taking his excited eyes off the prince’s face.
__label__di “I cannot marry at all,” said the latter.
__label__di “I am an invalid.”  “Would Rogojin marry her, do you think?”  “Why not? Certainly he would, I should think.
__label__di He would marry her tomorrow!--marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week!”  Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out.
__label__di “What’s the matter?” said he, seizing Gania’s hand.
__label__di “Your highness! His excellency begs your presence in her excellency’s apartments!” announced the footman, appearing at the door.
__label__di The prince immediately followed the man out of the room.
__label__di IV.
__label__di All three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy girls, well-grown, with good shoulders and busts, and strong--almost masculine--hands; and, of course, with all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital appetites, of which they were not in the least ashamed.
__label__di Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward deference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave, had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had judged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was well aware of the fact.
__label__di It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which was nearly as good as a dinner.
__label__di The young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten o’clock, while still in bed.
__label__di This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them.
__label__di At half-past twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if he had time.
__label__di Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various kinds (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on, there was generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies.
__label__di On the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had assembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the general’s appearance, the latter having promised to come this day.
__label__di If he had been one moment late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up punctually.
__label__di As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as his custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill.
__label__di He thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not altogether comfortable.
__label__di His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in their expression as well.
__label__di The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to be too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an experienced father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at once to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air.
__label__di However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order to explain the mutual relations between General Epanchin’s family and others acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the thread of their destiny.
__label__di I have already stated that the general, though he was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that, an experienced and talented husband and father.
__label__di Among other things, he considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grown-up daughters.
__label__di He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this question, though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish, because unnatural; but the general’s arguments were conclusive, and founded upon obvious facts.
__label__di The general considered that the girls’ taste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately, and that the parents’ duty should merely be to keep watch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made; but that the selection once effected, both father and mother were bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause, and to see that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily reached.
__label__di Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchins’ position gained each year, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and social weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better was their chance of making a brilliant match.
__label__di But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more, equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her twenty-fifth birthday.
__label__di Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying.
__label__di Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes.
__label__di He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty.
__label__di Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated.
__label__di Might he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general’s daughters?  Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the Epanchins was about to undergo a change.
__label__di The undoubted beauty of the family, _par excellence_, was the youngest, Aglaya, as aforesaid.
__label__di But Totski himself, though an egotist of the extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was clearly not for such as he.
__label__di Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or less exaggerated Aglaya’s chances of happiness.
__label__di In their opinion, the latter’s destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a heaven on earth.
__label__di Aglaya’s husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth.
__label__di The two elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need be, for Aglaya’s sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented.
__label__di The general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore, when Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer, since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry.
__label__di The general valued the proposal very highly.
__label__di He knew life, and realized what such an offer was worth.
__label__di The answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive, at least consoling and hopeful.
__label__di It made known that the eldest, Alexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.
__label__di Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own.
__label__di She was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski, she would make him a good wife.
__label__di She did not care for a brilliant marriage; she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome.
__label__di What better could Totski wish?  So the matter crept slowly forward.
__label__di The general and Totski had agreed to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step.
__label__di Alexandra’s parents had not even begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when suddenly, as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the proceedings.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and that was a serious matter.
__label__di A certain circumstance had crept in, a disagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the whole business.
__label__di This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before.
__label__di Close to an estate of Totski’s, in one of the central provinces of Russia, there lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description.
__label__di This gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards family and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate was mortgaged to the last acre.
__label__di One day, when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and that his wife had perished with it, but his children were safe.
__label__di Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could not stand this last stroke.
__label__di He went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital.
__label__di His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little girls--two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,--were adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart.
__label__di They were brought up together with the children of his German bailiff.
__label__di Very soon, however, there was only one of them left--Nastasia Philipovna--for the other little one died of whooping-cough.
__label__di Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff’s house, he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality--as to which last Totski was an undoubted authority.
__label__di He only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion, but he had time to make his arrangements.
__label__di Great changes took place in the child’s education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of experience and culture.
__label__di For four years this lady resided in the house with little Nastia, and then the education was considered complete.
__label__di The governess took her departure, and another lady came down to fetch Nastia, by Totski’s instructions.
__label__di The child was now transported to another of Totski’s estates in a distant part of the country.
__label__di Here she found a delightful little house, just built, and prepared for her reception with great care and taste; and here she took up her abode together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home.
__label__di In the house there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of all sorts, a charming “young lady’s library,” pictures, paint-boxes, a lap-dog, and everything to make life agreeable.
__label__di Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer, staying two and three months at a time.
__label__di So passed four years peacefully and happily, in charming surroundings.
__label__di At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski’s last visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman.
__label__di The report was only partially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna.
__label__di She suddenly displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski’s house, all alone.
__label__di The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure; but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone.
__label__di An entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the girl he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in common.
__label__di In the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was usual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge.
__label__di Surely not from her “young lady’s library”? It even embraced legal matters, and the “world” in general, to a considerable extent.
__label__di Her character was absolutely changed.
__label__di No more of the girlish alternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the reveries, the tears, the playfulness...
__label__di It was an entirely new and hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him, and informed him to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind, except loathing and contempt--contempt which had followed closely upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first acquaintance with him.
__label__di This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to prevent this marriage--for no particular reason, but that she _chose_ to do so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was “quite her turn to laugh a little now!”  Such were her words--very likely she did not give her real reason for this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the explanation she deigned to offer.
__label__di Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas would permit.
__label__di His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at the end of that time his resolution was taken.
__label__di The fact was, Totski was at that time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and respectable; his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe foundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position better than all the world, as every respectable gentleman should!  At the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only threaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no one.
__label__di There was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm of the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against whom or what, some insatiable contempt--in a word, something altogether absurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.
__label__di For a man of Totski’s wealth and standing, it would, of course, have been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at once from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia Philipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a scandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove her to a sphere of safety.
__label__di However, these arguments would only hold good in case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency.
__label__di She was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some extraordinary eccentricity.
__label__di Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead.
__label__di He realized that Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing by legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some entirely different intention.
__label__di Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of perpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense of loathing and contempt.
__label__di He had sufficient insight to understand that she valued nothing in the world--herself least of all--and he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects.
__label__di For instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar, or publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened; but not so much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted, as at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of society.
__label__di He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound him and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo, Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up.
__label__di His decision was strengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered of late.
__label__di It would be difficult to conceive how different she was physically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago.
__label__di She was pretty then...
__label__di but now!...
__label__di Totski laughed angrily when he thought how short-sighted he had been.
__label__di In days gone by he remembered how he had looked at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their dark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek an answer to some unknown riddle.
__label__di Her complexion also had altered.
__label__di She was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her more beautiful.
__label__di Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised such a cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think differently about it.
__label__di It had struck him as long ago as last spring that he ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office in another part of the country.
__label__di How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the idea of such a thing, now!  However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another way; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command.
__label__di In this way he might gain glory in certain circles.
__label__di Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that time a great deal happened.
__label__di Totski’s position was very uncomfortable; having “funked” once, he could not totally regain his ease.
__label__di He was afraid, he did not know why, but he was simply _afraid_ of Nastasia Philipovna.
__label__di For the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so.
__label__di He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side.
__label__di But to his great, and not entirely pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case, and that were he to offer himself he would be refused.
__label__di He could not understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude that it was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative woman, which had gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour.
__label__di To make matters worse, she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations, and could not be bribed in any way.
__label__di Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free.
__label__di He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he invited princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists, even Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest impression upon Nastasia.
__label__di It was as though she had a pebble in place of a heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered for ever.
__label__di She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved music.
__label__di Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a couple of actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher.
__label__di Among these people she was much beloved.
__label__di She received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening.
__label__di Totski often came.
__label__di Lately, too, General Epanchin had been enabled with great difficulty to introduce himself into her circle.
__label__di Gania made her acquaintance also, and others were Ferdishenko, an ill-bred, and would-be witty, young clerk, and Ptitsin, a money-lender of modest and polished manners, who had risen from poverty.
__label__di In fact, Nastasia Philipovna’s beauty became a thing known to all the town; but not a single man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for her; and this reputation of hers, and her wit and culture and grace, all confirmed Totski in the plan he had now prepared.
__label__di And it was at this moment that General Epanchin began to play so large and important a part in the story.
__label__di When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full and candid confession.
__label__di He had said that he intended to stop at no means to obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her; words were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some sort.
__label__di So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect.
__label__di Having arrived at Nastasia’s house one day, with Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position.
__label__di He admitted that he was to blame for all, but candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power over himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry at last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart.
__label__di General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the arbiter of Totski’s destiny at this moment.
__label__di He then pointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his other daughters, now hung upon her reply.
__label__di To Nastasia’s question as to what they wished her to do, Totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married.
__label__di He immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course, be absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature.
__label__di He very well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good family, namely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted, and whom she received at her house, had long loved her passionately, and would give his life for some response from her.
__label__di The young fellow had confessed this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it in the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin.
__label__di Lastly, he could not help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware of Gania’s love for her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she had looked with some favour upon it, being often lonely, and rather tired of her present life.
__label__di Having remarked how difficult it was for him, of all people, to speak to her of these matters, Totski concluded by saying that he trusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of seventy-five thousand roubles.
__label__di He added that the sum would have been left her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything, but that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be allowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc., etc.; in fact, all that would naturally be said under the circumstances.
__label__di Totski was very eloquent all through, and, in conclusion, just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world, not even General Epanchin, had ever heard a word about the above seventy-five thousand roubles, and that this was the first time he had ever given expression to his intentions in respect to them.
__label__di Nastasia Philipovna’s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the friends considerably.
__label__di Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which sent a cold chill down Totski’s back to this very day; but she seemed charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him for once in a way.
__label__di She confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but that pride had hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was broken, nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity.
__label__di First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes, she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now quite out of the question.
__label__di She said that she had long since changed her views of things, and recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart.
__label__di What was done was done and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should still feel alarmed.
__label__di She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously, that she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard none but good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep and sincere respect.
__label__di The idea alone that she could in any way serve them, would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness.
__label__di It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged her thoughts aright.
__label__di She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to family life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila Ardalionovitch, she could not as yet say much.
__label__di She thought it must be the case that he loved her; she felt that she too might learn to love him, if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself; but he was very young, and it was a difficult question to decide.
__label__di What she specially liked about him was that he worked, and supported his family by his toil.
__label__di She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that was interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from Mr. Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance, but--another question!--would they like to receive her into their house? At all events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she desired not to be hurried.
__label__di As for the seventy-five thousand roubles, Mr. Totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter; she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift.
__label__di She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no reason why Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.
__label__di She would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt persuaded that neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any sort of concealed suspicions as to herself.
__label__di She did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything in the past, which fact she desired to be known.
__label__di She did not consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch should be informed as to the relations which had existed between herself and Totski during the last five years.
__label__di If she accepted this money it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl, which had not been in any degree her own fault, but merely as compensation for her ruined life.
__label__di She became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and confessions that General Epanchin was highly gratified, and considered the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all.
__label__di But the once bitten Totski was twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers.
__label__di However, the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring about their object (namely, Gania’s attractiveness for Nastasia Philipovna), stood out more and more prominently; the pourparlers had commenced, and gradually even Totski began to believe in the possibility of success.
__label__di Before long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter over.
__label__di Very little was said--her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing such a question.
__label__di But she recognized his love, on the understanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever, and that she reserved the right to say “no” up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony.
__label__di Gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last moment.
__label__di It soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and quarrellings at the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the match, and that Nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident.
__label__di She said nothing about it, though he daily expected her to do so.
__label__di There were several rumours afloat, before long, which upset Totski’s equanimity a good deal, but we will not now stop to describe them; merely mentioning an instance or two.
__label__di One was that Nastasia had entered into close and secret relations with the Epanchin girls--a most unlikely rumour; another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and that his nature was gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary degree; and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest before, yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for their own purposes, it was clear enough that he had begun to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare.
__label__di In his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway, and although he had at last given his consent to marry the woman (as he said), under the stress of circumstances, yet he promised himself that he would “take it out of her,” after marriage.
__label__di Nastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and to be preparing something on her own account, which frightened him to such an extent that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general.
__label__di But at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances.
__label__di However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short time.
__label__di A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that the respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion.
__label__di What he thought to gain by Gania’s marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine.
__label__di Possibly he counted on Gania’s complaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding between the general and his secretary.
__label__di At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia’s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience.
__label__di The day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband’s infidelities, had heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest.
__label__di The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place--which fact alarmed him much.
__label__di This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family.
__label__di Before the prince’s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business, and “cut” the meal; which simply meant running away.
__label__di He was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed--especially the evening--without unpleasantness between himself and his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned up--“as though Heaven had sent him on purpose,” said the general to himself, as he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom.
__label__di V.
__label__di Mrs. General Epanchin was a proud woman by nature.
__label__di What must her feelings have been when she heard that Prince Muishkin, the last of his and her line, had arrived in beggar’s guise, a wretched idiot, a recipient of charity--all of which details the general gave out for greater effect! He was anxious to steal her interest at the first swoop, so as to distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight, and staring before her, without speaking, in moments of excitement.
__label__di She was a fine woman of the same age as her husband, with a slightly hooked nose, a high, narrow forehead, thick hair turning a little grey, and a sallow complexion.
__label__di Her eyes were grey and wore a very curious expression at times.
__label__di She believed them to be most effective--a belief that nothing could alter.
__label__di “What, receive him! Now, at once?” asked Mrs. Epanchin, gazing vaguely at her husband as he stood fidgeting before her.
__label__di “Oh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with him,” the general explained hastily.
__label__di “He is quite a child, not to say a pathetic-looking creature.
__label__di He has fits of some sort, and has just arrived from Switzerland, straight from the station, dressed like a German and without a farthing in his pocket.
__label__di I gave him twenty-five roubles to go on with, and am going to find him some easy place in one of the government offices.
__label__di I should like you to ply him well with the victuals, my dears, for I should think he must be very hungry.”  “You astonish me,” said the lady, gazing as before.
__label__di “Fits, and hungry too! What sort of fits?”  “Oh, they don’t come on frequently, besides, he’s a regular child, though he seems to be fairly educated.
__label__di I should like you, if possible, my dears,” the general added, making slowly for the door, “to put him through his paces a bit, and see what he is good for.
__label__di I think you should be kind to him; it is a good deed, you know--however, just as you like, of course--but he is a sort of relation, remember, and I thought it might interest you to see the young fellow, seeing that this is so.”  “Oh, of course, mamma, if we needn’t stand on ceremony with him, we must give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey; especially as he has not the least idea where to go to,” said Alexandra, the eldest of the girls.
__label__di “Besides, he’s quite a child; we can entertain him with a little hide-and-seek, in case of need,” said Adelaida.
__label__di “Hide-and-seek? What do you mean?” inquired Mrs. Epanchin.
__label__di “Oh, do stop pretending, mamma,” cried Aglaya, in vexation.
__label__di “Send him up, father; mother allows.”  The general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be shown in.
__label__di “Only on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,”  said Mrs. Epanchin, “and let Fedor, or Mavra, stand behind him while he eats.
__label__di Is he quiet when he has these fits? He doesn’t show violence, does he?”  “On the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up.
__label__di His manners are excellent--but here he is himself.
__label__di Here you are, prince--let me introduce you, the last of the Muishkins, a relative of your own, my dear, or at least of the same name.
__label__di Receive him kindly, please.
__label__di They’ll bring in lunch directly, prince; you must stop and have some, but you must excuse me.
__label__di I’m in a hurry, I must be off--”  “We all know where _you_ must be off to!” said Mrs. Epanchin, in a meaning voice.
__label__di “Yes, yes--I must hurry away, I’m late! Look here, dears, let him write you something in your albums; you’ve no idea what a wonderful caligraphist he is, wonderful talent! He has just written out ‘Abbot Pafnute signed this’ for me.
__label__di Well, _au revoir!_”  “Stop a minute; where are you off to? Who is this abbot?” cried Mrs. Epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance.
__label__di “Yes, my dear, it was an old abbot of that name--I must be off to see the count, he’s waiting for me, I’m late--Good-bye! _Au revoir_, prince!”--and the general bolted at full speed.
__label__di “Oh, yes--I know what count you’re going to see!” remarked his wife in a cutting manner, as she turned her angry eyes on the prince.
__label__di “Now then, what’s all this about?--What abbot--Who’s Pafnute?” she added, brusquely.
__label__di “Mamma!” said Alexandra, shocked at her rudeness.
__label__di Aglaya stamped her foot.
__label__di “Nonsense! Let me alone!” said the angry mother.
__label__di “Now then, prince, sit down here, no, nearer, come nearer the light! I want to have a good look at you.
__label__di So, now then, who is this abbot?”  “Abbot Pafnute,” said our friend, seriously and with deference.
__label__di “Pafnute, yes.
__label__di And who was he?”  Mrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely, and when the prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said.
__label__di “The Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,” began the prince; “he was in charge of one of the monasteries on the Volga, about where our present Kostroma government lies.
__label__di He went to Oreol and helped in the great matters then going on in the religious world; he signed an edict there, and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me, so I copied it.
__label__di When the general asked me, in his study, to write something for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote ‘The Abbot Pafnute signed this,’ in the exact handwriting of the abbot.
__label__di The general liked it very much, and that’s why he recalled it just now.”  “Aglaya, make a note of ‘Pafnute,’ or we shall forget him.
__label__di H’m! and where is this signature?”  “I think it was left on the general’s table.”  “Let it be sent for at once!”  “Oh, I’ll write you a new one in half a minute,” said the prince, “if you like!”  “Of course, mamma!” said Alexandra.
__label__di “But let’s have lunch now, we are all hungry!”  “Yes; come along, prince,” said the mother, “are you very hungry?”  “Yes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very much.”  “H’m! I like to see that you know your manners; and you are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to describe you.
__label__di Come along; you sit here, opposite to me,” she continued, “I wish to be able to see your face.
__label__di Alexandra, Adelaida, look after the prince! He doesn’t seem so very ill, does he? I don’t think he requires a napkin under his chin, after all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?”  “Formerly, when I was seven years old or so.
__label__di I believe I wore one; but now I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat.”  “Of course, of course! And about your fits?”  “Fits?” asked the prince, slightly surprised.
__label__di “I very seldom have fits nowadays.
__label__di I don’t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate may be bad for me.”  “He talks very well, you know!” said Mrs. Epanchin, who still continued to nod at each word the prince spoke.
__label__di “I really did not expect it at all; in fact, I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general’s part, as usual.
__label__di Eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and where you were brought up.
__label__di I wish to know all about you, you interest me very much!”  The prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the while, recommenced the narrative of his life in Switzerland, all of which we have heard before.
__label__di Mrs. Epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest; the girls, too, listened with considerable attention.
__label__di In talking over the question of relationship it turned out that the prince was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree off by heart.
__label__di It was found that scarcely any connection existed between himself and Mrs. Epanchin, but the talk, and the opportunity of conversing about her family tree, gratified the latter exceedingly, and she rose from the table in great good humour.
__label__di “Let’s all go to my boudoir,” she said, “and they shall bring some coffee in there.
__label__di That’s the room where we all assemble and busy ourselves as we like best,” she explained.
__label__di “Alexandra, my eldest, here, plays the piano, or reads or sews; Adelaida paints landscapes and portraits (but never finishes any); and Aglaya sits and does nothing.
__label__di I don’t work too much, either.
__label__di Here we are, now; sit down, prince, near the fire and talk to us.
__label__di I want to hear you relate something.
__label__di I wish to make sure of you first and then tell my old friend, Princess Bielokonski, about you.
__label__di I wish you to know all the good people and to interest them.
__label__di Now then, begin!”  “Mamma, it’s rather a strange order, that!” said Adelaida, who was fussing among her paints and paint-brushes at the easel.
__label__di Aglaya and Alexandra had settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa, evidently meaning to be listeners.
__label__di The prince felt that the general attention was concentrated upon himself.
__label__di “I should refuse to say a word if _I_ were ordered to tell a story like that!” observed Aglaya.
__label__di “Why? what’s there strange about it? He has a tongue.
__label__di Why shouldn’t he tell us something? I want to judge whether he is a good story-teller; anything you like, prince--how you liked Switzerland, what was your first impression, anything.
__label__di You’ll see, he’ll begin directly and tell us all about it beautifully.”  “The impression was forcible--” the prince began.
__label__di “There, you see, girls,” said the impatient lady, “he _has_ begun, you see.”  “Well, then, _let_ him talk, mamma,” said Alexandra.
__label__di “This prince is a great humbug and by no means an idiot,” she whispered to Aglaya.
__label__di “Oh, I saw that at once,” replied the latter.
__label__di “I don’t think it at all nice of him to play a part.
__label__di What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?”  “My first impression was a very strong one,” repeated the prince.
__label__di “When they took me away from Russia, I remember I passed through many German towns and looked out of the windows, but did not trouble so much as to ask questions about them.
__label__di This was after a long series of fits.
__label__di I always used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series, and lost my memory almost entirely; and though I was not altogether without reason at such times, yet I had no logical power of thought.
__label__di This would continue for three or four days, and then I would recover myself again.
__label__di I remember my melancholy was intolerable; I felt inclined to cry; I sat and wondered and wondered uncomfortably; the consciousness that everything was strange weighed terribly upon me; I could understand that it was all foreign and strange.
__label__di I recollect I awoke from this state for the first time at Basle, one evening; the bray of a donkey aroused me, a donkey in the town market.
__label__di I saw the donkey and was extremely pleased with it, and from that moment my head seemed to clear.”  “A donkey? How strange! Yet it is not strange.
__label__di Anyone of us might fall in love with a donkey! It happened in mythological times,” said Madame Epanchin, looking wrathfully at her daughters, who had begun to laugh.
__label__di “Go on, prince.”  “Since that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys.
__label__di I began to ask questions about them, for I had never seen one before; and I at once came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of animals--strong, willing, patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey, I began to like the whole country I was travelling through; and my melancholy passed away.”  “All this is very strange and interesting,” said Mrs. Epanchin.
__label__di “Now let’s leave the donkey and go on to other matters.
__label__di What are you laughing at, Aglaya? and you too, Adelaida? The prince told us his experiences very cleverly; he saw the donkey himself, and what have you ever seen? _you_ have never been abroad.”  “I have seen a donkey though, mamma!” said Aglaya.
__label__di “And I’ve heard one!” said Adelaida.
__label__di All three of the girls laughed out loud, and the prince laughed with them.
__label__di “Well, it’s too bad of you,” said mamma.
__label__di “You must forgive them, prince; they are good girls.
__label__di I am very fond of them, though I often have to be scolding them; they are all as silly and mad as march hares.”  “Oh, why shouldn’t they laugh?” said the prince.
__label__di “I shouldn’t have let the chance go by in their place, I know.
__label__di But I stick up for the donkey, all the same; he’s a patient, good-natured fellow.”  “Are you a patient man, prince? I ask out of curiosity,” said Mrs. Epanchin.
__label__di All laughed again.
__label__di “Oh, that wretched donkey again, I see!” cried the lady.
__label__di “I assure you, prince, I was not guilty of the least--”  “Insinuation? Oh! I assure you, I take your word for it.” And the prince continued laughing merrily.
__label__di “I must say it’s very nice of you to laugh.
__label__di I see you really are a kind-hearted fellow,” said Mrs. Epanchin.
__label__di “I’m not always kind, though.”  “I am kind myself, and _always_ kind too, if you please!” she retorted, unexpectedly; “and that is my chief fault, for one ought not to be always kind.
__label__di I am often angry with these girls and their father; but the worst of it is, I am always kindest when I am cross.
__label__di I was very angry just before you came, and Aglaya there read me a lesson--thanks, Aglaya, dear--come and kiss me--there--that’s enough” she added, as Aglaya came forward and kissed her lips and then her hand.
__label__di “Now then, go on, prince.
__label__di Perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the donkey, eh?”  “I must say, again, _I_ can’t understand how you can expect anyone to tell you stories straight away, so,” said Adelaida.
__label__di “I know I never could!”  “Yes, but the prince can, because he is clever--cleverer than you are by ten or twenty times, if you like.
__label__di There, that’s so, prince; and seriously, let’s drop the donkey now--what else did you see abroad, besides the donkey?”  “Yes, but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly, all the same,” said Alexandra.
__label__di “I have always been most interested to hear how people go mad and get well again, and that sort of thing.
__label__di Especially when it happens suddenly.”  “Quite so, quite so!” cried Mrs. Epanchin, delighted.
__label__di “I see you _can_ be sensible now and then, Alexandra.
__label__di You were speaking of Switzerland, prince?”  “Yes.
__label__di We came to Lucerne, and I was taken out in a boat.
__label__di I felt how lovely it was, but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other, and made me feel melancholy.”  “Why?” asked Alexandra.
__label__di “I don’t know; I always feel like that when I look at the beauties of nature for the first time; but then, I was ill at that time, of course!”  “Oh, but I should like to see it!” said Adelaida; “and I don’t know _when_ we shall ever go abroad.
__label__di I’ve been two years looking out for a good subject for a picture.
__label__di I’ve done all I know.
__label__di ‘The North and South I know by heart,’ as our poet observes.
__label__di Do help me to a subject, prince.”  “Oh, but I know nothing about painting.
__label__di It seems to me one only has to look, and paint what one sees.”  “But I don’t know _how_ to see!”  “Nonsense, what rubbish you talk!” the mother struck in.
__label__di “Not know how to see! Open your eyes and look! If you can’t see here, you won’t see abroad either.
__label__di Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!”  “Yes, that’s better,” said Adelaida; “the prince _learned to see_ abroad.”  “Oh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my health.
__label__di I don’t know whether I learned to see, exactly.
__label__di I was very happy, however, nearly all the time.”  “Happy! you can be happy?” cried Aglaya.
__label__di “Then how can you say you did not learn to see? I should think you could teach _us_ to see!”  “Oh! _do_ teach us,” laughed Adelaida.
__label__di “Oh! I can’t do that,” said the prince, laughing too.
__label__di “I lived almost all the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you? At first I was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to improve--then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the longer I stayed, the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I could not help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult to say.”  “So that you didn’t care to go away anywhere else?”  “Well, at first I did; I was restless; I didn’t know however I should manage to support life--you know there are such moments, especially in solitude.
__label__di There was a waterfall near us, such a lovely thin streak of water, like a thread but white and moving.
__label__di It fell from a great height, but it looked quite low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not seem fifty paces.
__label__di I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then that I became so restless.
__label__di Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the terrible silence, with our little village in the distance, and the sky so blue, and the sun so bright, and an old ruined castle on the mountain-side, far away.
__label__di I used to watch the line where earth and sky met, and longed to go and seek there the key of all mysteries, thinking that I might find there a new life, perhaps some great city where life should be grander and richer--and then it struck me that life may be grand enough even in a prison.”  “I read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual, when I was twelve years old,” said Aglaya.
__label__di “All this is pure philosophy,” said Adelaida.
__label__di “You are a philosopher, prince, and have come here to instruct us in your views.”  “Perhaps you are right,” said the prince, smiling.
__label__di “I think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?”  “Your philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know, who is rich and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend.
__label__di She talks of nothing but money all day.
__label__di Your great philosophical idea of a grand life in a prison and your four happy years in that Swiss village are like this, rather,” said Aglaya.
__label__di “As to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,” said the prince.
__label__di “I once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a prison--I heard it from the man himself.
__label__di He was one of the persons under treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy, then he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide.
__label__di _His_ life in prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating--but I think I had better tell you of another man I met last year.
__label__di There was a very strange feature in this case, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence.
__label__di This man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime.
__label__di Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die.
__label__di I was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt.
__label__di He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience.
__label__di “About twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the criminals (of whom there were several).
__label__di The first three criminals were taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them.
__label__di Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post.
__label__di My friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up.
__label__di A priest went about among them with a cross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live.
__label__di “He said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time into portions--one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a last look around.
__label__di He remembered having divided his time like this quite well.
__label__di While saying good-bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in the answer.
__label__di Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going to think about.
__label__di He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes.
__label__di A little way off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun.
__label__di He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light sparkling from it.
__label__di He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.
__label__di “The repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea, ‘What should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to life again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!’ He said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it.”  The prince paused and all waited, expecting him to go on again and finish the story.
__label__di “Is that all?” asked Aglaya.
__label__di “All? Yes,” said the prince, emerging from a momentary reverie.
__label__di “And why did you tell us this?”  “Oh, I happened to recall it, that’s all! It fitted into the conversation--”  “You probably wish to deduce, prince,” said Alexandra, “that moments of time cannot be reckoned by money value, and that sometimes five minutes are worth priceless treasures.
__label__di All this is very praiseworthy; but may I ask about this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience of his life? He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they did restore to him that ‘eternity of days.’ What did he do with these riches of time? Did he keep careful account of his minutes?”  “Oh no, he didn’t! I asked him myself.
__label__di He said that he had not lived a bit as he had intended, and had wasted many, and many a minute.”  “Very well, then there’s an experiment, and the thing is proved; one cannot live and count each moment; say what you like, but one _cannot_.”  “That is true,” said the prince, “I have thought so myself.
__label__di And yet, why shouldn’t one do it?”  “You think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?”  said Aglaya.
__label__di “I have had that idea.”  “And you have it still?”  “Yes--I have it still,” the prince replied.
__label__di He had contemplated Aglaya until now, with a pleasant though rather timid smile, but as the last words fell from his lips he began to laugh, and looked at her merrily.
__label__di “You are not very modest!” said she.
__label__di “But how brave you are!” said he.
__label__di “You are laughing, and I--that man’s tale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of it afterwards; yes, I dreamt of those five minutes...”  He looked at his listeners again with that same serious, searching expression.
__label__di “You are not angry with me?” he asked suddenly, and with a kind of nervous hurry, although he looked them straight in the face.
__label__di “Why should we be angry?” they cried.
__label__di “Only because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the time!”  At this they laughed heartily.
__label__di “Please don’t be angry with me,” continued the prince.
__label__di “I know very well that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less knowledge of it.
__label__di I must appear to speak strangely sometimes...”  He said the last words nervously.
__label__di “You say you have been happy, and that proves you have lived, not less, but more than other people.
__label__di Why make all these excuses?” interrupted Aglaya in a mocking tone of voice.
__label__di “Besides, you need not mind about lecturing us; you have nothing to boast of.
__label__di With your quietism, one could live happily for a hundred years at least.
__label__di One might show you the execution of a felon, or show you one’s little finger.
__label__di You could draw a moral from either, and be quite satisfied.
__label__di That sort of existence is easy enough.”  “I can’t understand why you always fly into a temper,” said Mrs. Epanchin, who had been listening to the conversation and examining the faces of the speakers in turn.
__label__di “I do not understand what you mean.
__label__di What has your little finger to do with it? The prince talks well, though he is not amusing.
__label__di He began all right, but now he seems sad.”  “Never mind, mamma! Prince, I wish you had seen an execution,” said Aglaya.
__label__di “I should like to ask you a question about that, if you had.”  “I have seen an execution,” said the prince.
__label__di “You have!” cried Aglaya.
__label__di “I might have guessed it.
__label__di That’s a fitting crown to the rest of the story.
__label__di If you have seen an execution, how can you say you lived happily all the while?”  “But is there capital punishment where you were?” asked Adelaida.
__label__di “I saw it at Lyons.
__label__di Schneider took us there, and as soon as we arrived we came in for that.”  “Well, and did you like it very much? Was it very edifying and instructive?” asked Aglaya.
__label__di “No, I didn’t like it at all, and was ill after seeing it; but I confess I stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight.
__label__di I could not tear them away.”  “I, too, should have been unable to tear my eyes away,” said Aglaya.
__label__di “They do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there.
__label__di The women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers.”  “That is, by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit that it is a sight for men.
__label__di I congratulate them on the deduction.
__label__di I suppose you quite agree with them, prince?”  “Tell us about the execution,” put in Adelaida.
__label__di “I would much rather not, just now,” said the prince, a little disturbed and frowning slightly.
__label__di “You don’t seem to want to tell us,” said Aglaya, with a mocking air.
__label__di “No,--the thing is, I was telling all about the execution a little while ago, and--”  “Whom did you tell about it?”  “The man-servant, while I was waiting to see the general.”  “Our man-servant?” exclaimed several voices at once.
__label__di “Yes, the one who waits in the entrance hall, a greyish, red-faced man--”  “The prince is clearly a democrat,” remarked Aglaya.
__label__di “Well, if you could tell Aleksey about it, surely you can tell us too.”  “I do so want to hear about it,” repeated Adelaida.
__label__di “Just now, I confess,” began the prince, with more animation, “when you asked me for a subject for a picture, I confess I had serious thoughts of giving you one.
__label__di I thought of asking you to draw the face of a criminal, one minute before the fall of the guillotine, while the wretched man is still standing on the scaffold, preparatory to placing his neck on the block.”  “What, his face? only his face?” asked Adelaida.
__label__di “That would be a strange subject indeed.
__label__di And what sort of a picture would that make?”  “Oh, why not?” the prince insisted, with some warmth.
__label__di “When I was in Basle I saw a picture very much in that style--I should like to tell you about it; I will some time or other; it struck me very forcibly.”  “Oh, you shall tell us about the Basle picture another time; now we must have all about the execution,” said Adelaida.
__label__di “Tell us about that face as it appeared to your imagination--how should it be drawn?--just the face alone, do you mean?”  “It was just a minute before the execution,” began the prince, readily, carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything else in a moment; “just at the instant when he stepped off the ladder on to the scaffold.
__label__di He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes and understood all, at once--but how am I to describe it? I do so wish you or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible.
__label__di I thought at the time what a picture it would make.
__label__di You must imagine all that went before, of course, all--all.
__label__di He had lived in the prison for some time and had not expected that the execution would take place for at least a week yet--he had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time; but it so happened that his papers had been got ready quickly.
__label__di At five o’clock in the morning he was asleep--it was October, and at five in the morning it was cold and dark.
__label__di The governor of the prison comes in on tip-toe and touches the sleeping man’s shoulder gently.
__label__di He starts up.
__label__di ‘What is it?’ he says.
__label__di ‘The execution is fixed for ten o’clock.’ He was only just awake, and would not believe at first, but began to argue that his papers would not be out for a week, and so on.
__label__di When he was wide awake and realized the truth, he became very silent and argued no more--so they say; but after a bit he said: ‘It comes very hard on one so suddenly’ and then he was silent again and said nothing.
__label__di “The three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary preparations--the priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some wine they gave him; doesn’t it seem ridiculous?) And yet I believe these people give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart, and believe that they are doing a good action.
__label__di Then he is dressed, and then begins the procession through the town to the scaffold.
__label__di I think he, too, must feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along.
__label__di Probably he thought, on the way, ‘Oh, I have a long, long time yet.
__label__di Three streets of life yet! When we’ve passed this street there’ll be that other one; and then that one where the baker’s shop is on the right; and when shall we get there? It’s ages, ages!’ Around him are crowds shouting, yelling--ten thousand faces, twenty thousand eyes.
__label__di All this has to be endured, and especially the thought: ‘Here are ten thousand men, and not one of them is going to be executed, and yet I am to die.’ Well, all that is preparatory.
__label__di “At the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst into tears--and this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say! There was a priest with him the whole time, talking; even in the cart as they drove along, he talked and talked.
__label__di Probably the other heard nothing; he would begin to listen now and then, and at the third word or so he had forgotten all about it.
__label__di “At last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so that he had to take very small steps.
__label__di The priest, who seemed to be a wise man, had stopped talking now, and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to kiss.
__label__di At the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough; but when he set foot on the scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became the colour of paper, positively like white notepaper.
__label__di His legs must have become suddenly feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his throat--you know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear, when one does not lose one’s wits, but is absolutely powerless to move? If some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen; if a house were just about to fall on one;--don’t you know how one would long to sit down and shut one’s eyes and wait, and wait? Well, when this terrible feeling came over him, the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips, without a word--a little silver cross it was--and he kept on pressing it to the man’s lips every second.
__label__di And whenever the cross touched his lips, the eyes would open for a moment, and the legs moved once, and he kissed the cross greedily, hurriedly--just as though he were anxious to catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards, though he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the time.
__label__di And so up to the very block.
__label__di “How strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment! On the contrary, the brain is especially active, and works incessantly--probably hard, hard, hard--like an engine at full pressure.
__label__di I imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his head--all unfinished ones, and strange, funny thoughts, very likely!--like this, for instance: ‘That man is looking at me, and he has a wart on his forehead! and the executioner has burst one of his buttons, and the lowest one is all rusty!’ And meanwhile he notices and remembers everything.
__label__di There is one point that cannot be forgotten, round which everything else dances and turns about; and because of this point he cannot faint, and this lasts until the very final quarter of a second, when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens and waits and _knows_--that’s the point, he _knows_ that he is just _now_ about to die, and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head.
__label__di If I lay there, I should certainly listen for that grating sound, and hear it, too! There would probably be but the tenth part of an instant left to hear it in, but one would certainly hear it.
__label__di And imagine, some people declare that when the head flies off it is _conscious_ of having flown off! Just imagine what a thing to realize! Fancy if consciousness were to last for even five seconds!  “Draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in clearly.
__label__di The criminal must be just stepping on to it, his face as white as note-paper.
__label__di The priest is holding the cross to his blue lips, and the criminal kisses it, and knows and sees and understands everything.
__label__di The cross and the head--there’s your picture; the priest and the executioner, with his two assistants, and a few heads and eyes below.
__label__di Those might come in as subordinate accessories--a sort of mist.
__label__di There’s a picture for you.” The prince paused, and looked around.
__label__di “Certainly that isn’t much like quietism,” murmured Alexandra, half to herself.
__label__di “Now tell us about your love affairs,” said Adelaida, after a moment’s pause.
__label__di The prince gazed at her in amazement.
__label__di “You know,” Adelaida continued, “you owe us a description of the Basle picture; but first I wish to hear how you fell in love.
__label__di Don’t deny the fact, for you did, of course.
__label__di Besides, you stop philosophizing when you are telling about anything.”  “Why are you ashamed of your stories the moment after you have told them?” asked Aglaya, suddenly.
__label__di “How silly you are!” said Mrs. Epanchin, looking indignantly towards the last speaker.
__label__di “Yes, that wasn’t a clever remark,” said Alexandra.
__label__di “Don’t listen to her, prince,” said Mrs. Epanchin; “she says that sort of thing out of mischief.
__label__di Don’t think anything of their nonsense, it means nothing.
__label__di They love to chaff, but they like you.
__label__di I can see it in their faces--I know their faces.”  “I know their faces, too,” said the prince, with a peculiar stress on the words.
__label__di “How so?” asked Adelaida, with curiosity.
__label__di “What do _you_ know about our faces?” exclaimed the other two, in chorus.
__label__di But the prince was silent and serious.
__label__di All awaited his reply.
__label__di “I’ll tell you afterwards,” he said quietly.
__label__di “Ah, you want to arouse our curiosity!” said Aglaya.
__label__di “And how terribly solemn you are about it!”  “Very well,” interrupted Adelaida, “then if you can read faces so well, you _must_ have been in love.
__label__di Come now; I’ve guessed--let’s have the secret!”  “I have not been in love,” said the prince, as quietly and seriously as before.
__label__di “I have been happy in another way.”  “How, how?”  “Well, I’ll tell you,” said the prince, apparently in a deep reverie.
__label__di VI.
__label__di “Here you all are,” began the prince, “settling yourselves down to listen to me with so much curiosity, that if I do not satisfy you you will probably be angry with me.
__label__di No, no! I’m only joking!” he added, hastily, with a smile.
__label__di “Well, then--they were all children there, and I was always among children and only with children.
__label__di They were the children of the village in which I lived, and they went to the school there--all of them.
__label__di I did not teach them, oh no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut.
__label__di I may have taught them some things, but I was among them just as an outsider, and I passed all four years of my life there among them.
__label__di I wished for nothing better; I used to tell them everything and hid nothing from them.
__label__di Their fathers and relations were very angry with me, because the children could do nothing without me at last, and used to throng after me at all times.
__label__di The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end! I had many enemies, and all because of the children.
__label__di Even Schneider reproached me.
__label__di What were they afraid of? One can tell a child everything, anything.
__label__di I have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little.
__label__di They should not conceal so much from them.
__label__di How well even little children understand that their parents conceal things from them, because they consider them too young to understand! Children are capable of giving advice in the most important matters.
__label__di How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly? I call them birds because there is nothing in the world better than birds!  “However, most of the people were angry with me about one and the same thing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of me.
__label__di At first he had wagged his head and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told them so well, and could not learn from him; and he laughed like anything when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very much, but that _they_ might teach us a good deal.
__label__di “How he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me, living among children as he did, is what I cannot understand.
__label__di Children soothe and heal the wounded heart.
__label__di I remember there was one poor fellow at our professor’s who was being treated for madness, and you have no idea what those children did for him, eventually.
__label__di I don’t think he was mad, but only terribly unhappy.
__label__di But I’ll tell you all about him another day.
__label__di Now I must get on with this story.
__label__di “The children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly, awkward kind of a fellow then--and I know I am ugly.
__label__di Besides, I was a foreigner.
__label__di The children used to laugh at me, at first; and they even went so far as to throw stones at me, when they saw me kiss Marie.
__label__di I only kissed her once in my life--no, no, don’t laugh!” The prince hastened to suppress the smiles of his audience at this point.
__label__di “It was not a matter of _love_ at all! If only you knew what a miserable creature she was, you would have pitied her, just as I did.
__label__di She belonged to our village.
__label__di Her mother was an old, old woman, and they used to sell string and thread, and soap and tobacco, out of the window of their little house, and lived on the pittance they gained by this trade.
__label__di The old woman was ill and very old, and could hardly move.
__label__di Marie was her daughter, a girl of twenty, weak and thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work at the houses around, day by day.
__label__di Well, one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and carried her off; and a week later he deserted her.
__label__di She came home dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had walked for a whole week without shoes; she had slept in the fields, and caught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen and sore, and her hands torn and scratched all over.
__label__di She never had been pretty even before; but her eyes were quiet, innocent, kind eyes.
__label__di “She was very quiet always--and I remember once, when she had suddenly begun singing at her work, everyone said, ‘Marie tried to sing today!’ and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after.
__label__di She had been treated kindly in the place before; but when she came back now--ill and shunned and miserable--not one of them all had the slightest sympathy for her.
__label__di Cruel people! Oh, what hazy understandings they have on such matters! Her mother was the first to show the way.
__label__di She received her wrathfully, unkindly, and with contempt.
__label__di ‘You have disgraced me,’ she said.
__label__di She was the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all heard that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see her and crowded into the little cottage--old men, children, women, girls--such a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd.
__label__di Marie was lying on the floor at the old woman’s feet, hungry, torn, draggled, crying, miserable.
__label__di “When everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her dishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor.
__label__di Everyone looked at her as though she were a piece of dirt off the road.
__label__di The old men scolded and condemned, and the young ones laughed at her.
__label__di The women condemned her too, and looked at her contemptuously, just as though she were some loathsome insect.
__label__di “Her mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her head and encouraged them.
__label__di The old woman was very ill at that time, and knew she was dying (she really did die a couple of months later), and though she felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter, to the very day of her death.
__label__di She would not even speak to her.
__label__di She made her sleep on straw in a shed, and hardly gave her food enough to support life.
__label__di “Marie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and did everything for her; but the old woman accepted all her services without a word and never showed her the slightest kindness.
__label__di Marie bore all this; and I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite right and fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures.
__label__di “When the old woman took to her bed finally, the other old women in the village sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie was quite driven out of the house.
__label__di They gave her no food at all, and she could not get any work in the village; none would employ her.
__label__di The men seemed to consider her no longer a woman, they said such dreadful things to her.
__label__di Sometimes on Sundays, if they were drunk enough, they used to throw her a penny or two, into the mud, and Marie would silently pick up the money.
__label__di She had began to spit blood at that time.
__label__di “At last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of appearing in the village any longer.
__label__di The children used to pelt her with mud; so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd would not have her.
__label__di Then she took to helping him without leave; and he saw how valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her away again; on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the remnants of his dinner, bread and cheese.
__label__di He considered that he was being very kind.
__label__di When the mother died, the village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie up to public derision and shame.
__label__di Marie was standing at the coffin’s head, in all her rags, crying.
__label__di “A crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry.
__label__di The parson, a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher, began his sermon and pointed to Marie.
__label__di ‘There,’ he said, ‘there is the cause of the death of this venerable woman’--(which was a lie, because she had been ill for at least two years)--‘there she stands before you, and dares not lift her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God is upon her.
__label__di Look at her tatters and rags--the badge of those who lose their virtue.
__label__di Who is she? her daughter!’ and so on to the end.
__label__di “And just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly.
__label__di Only the children had altered--for then they were all on my side and had learned to love Marie.
__label__di “This is how it was: I had wished to do something for Marie; I longed to give her some money, but I never had a farthing while I was there.
__label__twp Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.
__label__twp But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”  It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.
__label__twp With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days.
__label__twp She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St.
__label__twp Petersburg, used only by the elite.
__label__twp All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:  “If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Schérer.”  “Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception.
__label__twp He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face.
__label__twp He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court.
__label__twp He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.
__label__twp “First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are.
__label__twp Set your friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.
__label__twp “Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp “You are staying the whole evening, I hope?”  “And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday.
__label__twp I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince.
__label__twp “My daughter is coming for me to take me there.”
__label__twp “I thought today’s fete had been canceled.
__label__twp I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”  “If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.
__label__twp “Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.”  “What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone.
__label__twp “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”  Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness.
__label__twp To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her.
__label__twp The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.
__label__twp In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst out:  “Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria.
__label__twp Perhaps I don’t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.
__label__twp She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe.
__label__twp Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it.
__label__twp That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him.
__label__twp He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one....
__label__twp Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?...
__label__twp England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander’s loftiness of soul.
__label__twp She has refused to evacuate Malta.
__label__twp She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions.
__label__twp What answer did Novosíltsev get? None.
__label__twp The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind.
__label__twp And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him....
__label__twp And I don’t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either.
__label__twp This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap.
__label__twp I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch.
__label__twp He will save Europe!”  She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
__label__twp “I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia’s consent by assault.
__label__twp You are so eloquent.
__label__twp Will you give me a cup of tea?”  “In a moment.
__label__twp À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families.
__label__twp He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones.
__label__twp And also the Abbé Morio.
__label__twp Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor.
__label__twp Had you heard?”  “I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince.
__label__twp “But tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.”  Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the baron.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.
__label__twp “Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
__label__twp As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness.
__label__twp She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
__label__twp The prince was silent and looked indifferent.
__label__twp But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:  “Now about your family.
__label__twp Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.”  The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
__label__twp “I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed.
__label__twp Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest.
__label__twp I don’t like him,” she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.
__label__twp “Two such charming children.
__label__twp And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.”  And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
__label__twp “I can’t help it,” said the prince.
__label__twp “Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.”  “Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you.
__label__twp Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and you were pitied....”  The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply.
__label__twp He frowned.
__label__twp “What would you have me do?” he said at last.
__label__twp “You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
__label__twp Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one.
__label__twp That is the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.
__label__twp “And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna Pávlovna, looking up pensively.
__label__twp “I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life.
__label__twp It is the cross I have to bear.
__label__twp That is how I explain it to myself.
__label__twp It can’t be helped!”  He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna meditated.
__label__twp “Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she asked.
__label__twp “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father.
__label__twp She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.”  Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information.
__label__twp “Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?” Presently he added: “That’s what we fathers have to put up with....
__label__twp Is this princess of yours rich?”  “Her father is very rich and stingy.
__label__twp He lives in the country.
__label__twp He is the well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore.
__label__twp The poor girl is very unhappy.
__label__twp She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.
__label__twp He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov’s and will be here tonight.”  “Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna’s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards.
__label__twp “Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports.
__label__twp She is rich and of good family and that’s all I want.”  And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.
__label__twp “Attendez,” said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to Lise, young Bolkónski’s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged.
__label__twp It shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.”      CHAPTER II  Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling.
__label__twp The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli’s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her father to the ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor.
__label__twp The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya, known as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there.
__label__twp She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli’s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.
__label__twp The Abbé Morio and many others had also come.
__label__twp * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.
__label__twp To each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my aunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then left them.
__label__twp Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval.
__label__twp The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, “who, thank God, was better today.” And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.
__label__twp The young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag.
__label__twp Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip.
__label__twp As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty.
__label__twp Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly.
__label__twp Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health.
__label__twp All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.
__label__twp The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her.
__label__twp “I have brought my work,” said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.
__label__twp “Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,” she added, turning to her hostess.
__label__twp “You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.” And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.
__label__twp “Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,” replied Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp “You know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed.
__label__twp Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she added, addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.
__label__twp “What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat.
__label__twp This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known grandee of Catherine’s time who now lay dying in Moscow.
__label__twp The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room.
__label__twp But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter.
__label__twp Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.
__label__twp “It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.
__label__twp Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something.
__label__twp On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’s health.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “Do you know the Abbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.”  “Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.”  “You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess.
__label__twp But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness.
__label__twp First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away.
__label__twp With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s plan chimerical.
__label__twp “We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.
__label__twp And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag.
__label__twp As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion.
__label__twp But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident.
__label__twp She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.
__label__twp Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia.
__label__twp He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard.
__label__twp Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound.
__label__twp At last he came up to Morio.
__label__twp Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.
__label__twp CHAPTER III  Anna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing.
__label__twp The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides.
__label__twp With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups.
__label__twp One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé.
__label__twp Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince Vasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.
__label__twp The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests.
__label__twp As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels.
__label__twp The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d’Enghien.
__label__twp The vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte’s hatred of him.
__label__twp “Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence: “Contez nous çela, Vicomte.”  The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to listen to his tale.
__label__twp “The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to one of the guests.
__label__twp “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she to another.
__label__twp “How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.
__label__twp The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.
__label__twp “Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.
__label__twp The princess smiled.
__label__twp She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman.
__label__twp With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp Hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty.
__label__twp She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.
__label__twp “How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile.
__label__twp “Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he, smilingly inclining his head.
__label__twp The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary.
__label__twp She smilingly waited.
__label__twp All the time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace.
__label__twp From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.
__label__twp The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.
__label__twp “Wait a moment, I’ll get my work....
__label__twp Now then, what are you thinking of?” she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte.
__label__twp “Fetch me my workbag.”  There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.
__label__twp “Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took up her work.
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.
__label__twp Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly.
__label__twp His features were like his sister’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak.
__label__twp His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.
__label__twp “It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak.
__label__twp “Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders.
__label__twp “Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them.
__label__twp He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid.
__label__twp He was dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.
__label__twp The vicomte told his tale very neatly.
__label__twp It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy.
__label__twp The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.
__label__twp The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.
__label__twp “Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.
__label__twp “Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it.
__label__twp The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the rescue.
__label__twp Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory.
__label__twp Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved.
__label__twp “The means are ...
__label__twp the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,” the abbé was saying.
__label__twp “It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!”  “But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning.
__label__twp At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate.
__label__twp The Italian’s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.
__label__twp “I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,” said he.
__label__twp Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger circle.
__label__twp CHAPTER IV  Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew Bolkónski, the little princess’ husband.
__label__twp He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features.
__label__twp Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife.
__label__twp It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them.
__label__twp And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife.
__label__twp He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.
__label__twp “You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp “General Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general’s name like a Frenchman, “has been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....”  “And Lise, your wife?”  “She will go to the country.”  “Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”  “André,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!”  Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away.
__label__twp Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm.
__label__twp Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.
__label__twp “There now!...
__label__twp So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to Pierre.
__label__twp “I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre.
__label__twp “I will come to supper with you.
__label__twp May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story.
__label__twp “No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre’s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question.
__label__twp He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.
__label__twp “You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising.
__label__twp “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you.
__label__twp I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp His daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face.
__label__twp Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.
__label__twp “Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Very,” said Pierre.
__label__twp In passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna: “Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.
__label__twp Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.”   Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand.
__label__twp She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s.
__label__twp The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasíli in the anteroom.
__label__twp All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.
__label__twp “How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom.
__label__twp “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg.
__label__twp Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy.”  Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.
__label__twp “What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?” said she.
__label__twp “Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered Prince Vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor.
__label__twp I should advise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn.
__label__twp That would be the best way.”  The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections.
__label__twp She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.
__label__twp It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte’s story.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli’s arm more tightly.
__label__twp “Listen to me, Prince,” said she.
__label__twp “I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father’s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’s sake to do this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,” she added hurriedly.
__label__twp “No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have asked Golítsyn and he has refused.
__label__twp Be the kindhearted man you always were,” she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.
__label__twp “Papa, we shall be late,” said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.
__label__twp Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence.
__label__twp But in Princess Drubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience.
__label__twp She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career.
__label__twp Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes.
__label__twp This last consideration moved him.
__label__twp “My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s memory, I will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the Guards.
__label__twp Here is my hand on it.
__label__twp Are you satisfied?”  “My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew your kindness!” He turned to go.
__label__twp “Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...” she faltered.
__label__twp “You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ...
__label__twp recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...”  Prince Vasíli smiled.
__label__twp “No, I won’t promise that.
__label__twp You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief.
__label__twp He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.”  “No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My dear benefactor...”  “Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, “we shall be late.”  “Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?”  “Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”  “Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promise.”  “Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.
__label__twp Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts.
__label__twp But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression.
__label__twp She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave.
__label__twp Her task was accomplished.
__label__twp “And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?” asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy.”  Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile.
__label__twp “‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’ * They say he was very fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato.
__label__twp Guai a chi la tocchi!’’       * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!  “I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over,” Anna Pávlovna continued.
__label__twp “The sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.”  “The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: “The sovereigns, madame...
__label__twp What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became more animated.
__label__twp “And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause.
__label__twp The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.”  And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé coat of arms on the table.
__label__twp He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it.
__label__twp “Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,” said he.
__label__twp The princess listened, smiling.
__label__twp “If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too far.
__label__twp By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—I mean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, and then....”  He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands.
__label__twp Pierre wished to make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted:  “The Emperor Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.
__label__twp “That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far.
__label__twp I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime.”  “From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte’s side.”  “It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre.
__label__twp “At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion.”  “Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.
__label__twp It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him, though without looking at him.
__label__twp “‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,’” Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon’s words.
__label__twp “‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.’ I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”  “Not in the least,” replied the vicomte.
__label__twp “After the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero.
__label__twp If to some people,” he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth.”  Before Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.
__label__twp “The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre, “was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed.”  “Dieu! Mon Dieu!” muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.
__label__twp “What, Monsieur Pierre...
__label__twp Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work nearer to her.
__label__twp “Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices.
__label__twp “Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand.
__label__twp The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders.
__label__twp Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued.
__label__twp “I say so,” he continued desperately, “because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man’s life.”  “Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
__label__twp “No,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain power.”  “Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him a great man,” remarked the vicomte.
__label__twp “He could not do that.
__label__twp The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man.
__label__twp The Revolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.
__label__twp “What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?...
__label__twp Well, after that...
__label__twp But won’t you come to this other table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp “Rousseau’s Contrat Social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.
__label__twp “I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.”  “Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an ironical voice.
__label__twp “Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important.
__label__twp What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force.”  “Liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited.
__label__twp Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality.
__label__twp Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary.
__label__twp We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.”  Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess.
__label__twp In the first moment of Pierre’s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck.
__label__twp But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.
__label__twp “But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is innocent and untried?”  “I should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!”  “And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders.
__label__twp “He’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince Hippolyte.
__label__twp Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled.
__label__twp His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people.
__label__twp When he smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another—a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness.
__label__twp The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested.
__label__twp All were silent.
__label__twp “How do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.
__label__twp So it seems to me.”  “Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement.
__label__twp “One must admit,” continued Prince Andrew, “that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ...
__label__twp but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify.”  Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go.
__label__twp Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend, and asking them all to be seated began:  “I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.
__label__twp Excuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost....” And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.
__label__twp Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story.
__label__twp “There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy.
__label__twp She must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones.
__label__twp That was her taste.
__label__twp And she had a lady’s maid, also big.
__label__twp She said....”  Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty.
__label__twp “She said....
__label__twp Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.’”  Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator.
__label__twp Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did however smile.
__label__twp “She went.
__label__twp Suddenly there was a great wind.
__label__twp The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down....” Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole world knew....”  And so the anecdote ended.
__label__twp Though it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst.
__label__twp After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where.
__label__twp CHAPTER VI  Having thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their leave.
__label__twp Pierre was ungainly.
__label__twp Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly agreeable before going away.
__label__twp Besides this he was absent-minded.
__label__twp When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general’s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it.
__label__twp All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: “I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.”  When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “Opinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.” And everyone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt this.
__label__twp Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to his wife’s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall.
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.
__label__twp “Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess, taking leave of Anna Pávlovna.
__label__twp “It is settled,” she added in a low voice.
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess’ sister-in-law.
__label__twp “I rely on you, my dear,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone.
__label__twp “Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter.
__label__twp Au revoir! ”—and she left the hall.
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face close to her, began to whisper something.
__label__twp Two footmen, the princess’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish.
__label__twp They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so.
__label__twp The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.
__label__twp “I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador’s,” said Prince Hippolyte “—so dull—.
__label__twp It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!”  “They say the ball will be very good,” replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip.
__label__twp “All the pretty women in society will be there.”  “Not all, for you will not be there; not all,” said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess.
__label__twp Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her.
__label__twp Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her husband.
__label__twp Prince Andrew’s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he seem.
__label__twp “Are you ready?” he asked his wife, looking past her.
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.
__label__twp “Princesse, au revoir,” cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet.
__label__twp The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone’s way.
__label__twp “Allow me, sir,” said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.
__label__twp “I am expecting you, Pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and affectionately.
__label__twp The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled.
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home.
__label__twp “Well, mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very nice indeed, quite French,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers.
__label__twp Hippolyte burst out laughing.
__label__twp “Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,” continued the vicomte.
__label__twp “I pity the poor husband, that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch.”  Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, “And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to know how to deal with them.”  Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew’s study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar’s Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.
__label__twp “What have you done to Mlle Schérer? She will be quite ill now,” said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.
__label__twp Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak.
__label__twp He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.
__label__twp “That abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light....
__label__twp In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but—I do not know how to express it ...
__label__twp not by a balance of political power....”  It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation.
__label__twp “One can’t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher.
__label__twp Well, have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?” asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.
__label__twp Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.
__label__twp “Really, I don’t yet know.
__label__twp I don’t like either the one or the other.”  “But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.”  Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty.
__label__twp When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man, “Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession.
__label__twp I will agree to anything.
__label__twp Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is money.
__label__twp Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.” Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything.
__label__twp It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.
__label__twp Pierre rubbed his forehead.
__label__twp “But he must be a Freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom he had met that evening.
__label__twp “That is all nonsense.” Prince Andrew again interrupted him, “let us talk business.
__label__twp Have you been to the Horse Guards?”  “No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you.
__label__twp There is a war now against Napoleon.
__label__twp If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.”  Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’s childish words.
__label__twp He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question.
__label__twp “If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,” he said.
__label__twp “And that would be splendid,” said Pierre.
__label__twp Prince Andrew smiled ironically.
__label__twp “Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....”  “Well, why are you going to the war?” asked Pierre.
__label__twp “What for? I don’t know.
__label__twp I must.
__label__twp Besides that I am going....” He paused.
__label__twp “I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!”      CHAPTER VII  The rustle of a woman’s dress was heard in the next room.
__label__twp Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room.
__label__twp Pierre removed his feet from the sofa.
__label__twp The princess came in.
__label__twp She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other.
__label__twp Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.
__label__twp “How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, “how is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women.
__label__twp What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!”  “And I am still arguing with your husband.
__label__twp I can’t understand why he wants to go to the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women.
__label__twp The princess started.
__label__twp Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the quick.
__label__twp “Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she.
__label__twp “I don’t understand it; I don’t in the least understand why men can’t live without wars.
__label__twp How is it that we women don’t want anything of the kind, don’t need it? Now you shall judge between us.
__label__twp I always tell him: Here he is Uncle’s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position.
__label__twp He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone.
__label__twp The other day at the Apráksins’ I heard a lady asking, ‘Is that the famous Prince Andrew?’ I did indeed.” She laughed.
__label__twp “He is so well received everywhere.
__label__twp He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor.
__label__twp You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously.
__label__twp Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it.
__label__twp What do you think?”  Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the conversation, gave no reply.
__label__twp “When are you starting?” he asked.
__label__twp “Oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t! I won’t hear it spoken of,” said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.
__label__twp “Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ...
__label__twp and then you know, André...” (she looked significantly at her husband) “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.
__label__twp Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness.
__label__twp “What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’t understand,” said he.
__label__twp “There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country.”  “With my father and sister, remember,” said Prince Andrew gently.
__label__twp “Alone all the same, without my friends....
__label__twp And he expects me not to be afraid.”  Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression.
__label__twp She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that.
__label__twp “I still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.
__label__twp The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.
__label__twp “No, Andrew, I must say you have changed.
__label__twp Oh, how you have....”  “Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “You had better go.”  The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.
__label__twp Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.
__label__twp Pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.
__label__twp “Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace.
__label__twp “I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me.
__label__twp Why is it?”  “Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said.
__label__twp But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words.
__label__twp But she went on hurriedly:  “You treat me like an invalid or a child.
__label__twp I see it all! Did you behave like that six months ago?”  “Lise, I beg you to desist,” said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.
__label__twp Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached the princess.
__label__twp He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.
__label__twp “Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because....
__label__twp I assure you I myself have experienced ...
__label__twp and so ...
__label__twp because ...
__label__twp No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here....
__label__twp No, don’t distress yourself....
__label__twp Good-by!”  Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.
__label__twp “No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.”  “No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears.
__label__twp “Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted.
__label__twp Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear.
__label__twp Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail.
__label__twp “Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!” she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.
__label__twp “Good night, Lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger.
__label__twp CHAPTER VIII  The friends were silent.
__label__twp Neither cared to begin talking.
__label__twp Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand.
__label__twp “Let us go and have supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door.
__label__twp They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.
__label__twp Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.
__label__twp Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out.
__label__twp “Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That’s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake.
__label__twp Marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is good and noble in you will be lost.
__label__twp It will all be wasted on trifles.
__label__twp Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t look at me with such surprise.
__label__twp If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!...
__label__twp But what’s the good?...” and he waved his arm.
__label__twp Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement.
__label__twp “My wife,” continued Prince Andrew, “is an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a man’s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.”  As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkónski who had lolled in Anna Pávlovna’s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth.
__label__twp Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light.
__label__twp It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.
__label__twp “You don’t understand why I say this,” he continued, “but it is the whole story of life.
__label__twp You talk of Bonaparte and his career,” said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), “but Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal.
__label__twp He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it.
__label__twp But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret.
__label__twp Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from.
__label__twp I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing.
__label__twp I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,” continued Prince Andrew, “and at Anna Pávlovna’s they listen to me.
__label__twp And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women....
__label__twp If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right.
__label__twp Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything—that’s what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there’s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don’t marry, my dear fellow; don’t marry!” concluded Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “It seems funny to me,” said Pierre, “that you, you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life.
__label__twp You have everything before you, everything.
__label__twp And you....”  He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.
__label__twp “How can he talk like that?” thought Pierre.
__label__twp He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will.
__label__twp Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew’s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study.
__label__twp And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew’s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.
__label__twp Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.
__label__twp “My part is played out,” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “What’s the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you,” he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.
__label__twp That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’s face.
__label__twp “But what is there to say about me?” said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile.
__label__twp “What am I? An illegitimate son!” He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this.
__label__twp “Without a name and without means...
__label__twp And it really...” But he did not say what “it really” was.
__label__twp “For the present I am free and am all right.
__label__twp Only I haven’t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.”  Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance—friendly and affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority.
__label__twp “I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our whole set.
__label__twp Yes, you’re all right! Choose what you will; it’s all the same.
__label__twp You’ll be all right anywhere.
__label__twp But look here: give up visiting those Kurágins and leading that sort of life.
__label__twp It suits you so badly—all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!”  “What would you have, my dear fellow?” answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders.
__label__twp “Women, my dear fellow; women!”  “I don’t understand it,” replied Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Women who are comme il faut, that’s a different matter; but the Kurágins’ set of women, ‘women and wine’ I don’t understand!”  Pierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew’s sister.
__label__twp “Do you know?” said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, “seriously, I have long been thinking of it....
__label__twp Leading such a life I can’t decide or think properly about anything.
__label__twp One’s head aches, and one spends all one’s money.
__label__twp He asked me for tonight, but I won’t go.”  “You give me your word of honor not to go?”  “On my honor!”      CHAPTER IX  It was past one o’clock when Pierre left his friend.
__label__twp It was a cloudless, northern, summer night.
__label__twp Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home.
__label__twp But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night.
__label__twp It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night.
__label__twp On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.
__label__twp “I should like to go to Kurágin’s,” thought he.
__label__twp But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there.
__label__twp Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go.
__label__twp The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; “besides,” thought he, “all such ‘words of honor’ are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!” Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions.
__label__twp He went to Kurágin’s.
__label__twp Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards’ barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door.
__label__twp There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.
__label__twp Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.
__label__twp Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper.
__label__twp A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses.
__label__twp From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion.
__label__twp Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window.
__label__twp Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.
__label__twp “I bet a hundred on Stevens!” shouted one.
__label__twp “Mind, no holding on!” cried another.
__label__twp “I bet on Dólokhov!” cried a third.
__label__twp “Kurágin, you part our hands.”  “There, leave Bruin alone; here’s a bet on.”  “At one draught, or he loses!” shouted a fourth.
__label__twp “Jacob, bring a bottle!” shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front.
__label__twp “Wait a bit, you fellows....
__label__twp Here is Pétya! Good man!” cried he, addressing Pierre.
__label__twp Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: “Come here; part the bets!” This was Dólokhov, an officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole.
__label__twp Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.
__label__twp “I don’t understand.
__label__twp What’s it all about?”  “Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,” said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.
__label__twp “First of all you must drink!”  Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter.
__label__twp Anatole kept on refilling Pierre’s glass while explaining that Dólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.
__label__twp “Go on, you must drink it all,” said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, “or I won’t let you go!”  “No, I won’t,” said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window.
__label__twp Dólokhov was holding the Englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre.
__label__twp Dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes.
__label__twp He was about twenty-five.
__label__twp Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen.
__label__twp The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved.
__label__twp The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.
__label__twp Dólokhov was a man of small means and no connections.
__label__twp Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole.
__label__twp Dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won.
__label__twp However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.
__label__twp Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.
__label__twp The bottle of rum was brought.
__label__twp The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around.
__label__twp Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window.
__label__twp He wanted to smash something.
__label__twp Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not move it.
__label__twp He smashed a pane.
__label__twp “You have a try, Hercules,” said he, turning to Pierre.
__label__twp Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash.
__label__twp “Take it right out, or they’ll think I’m holding on,” said Dólokhov.
__label__twp “Is the Englishman bragging?...
__label__twp Eh? Is it all right?” said Anatole.
__label__twp “First-rate,” said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.
__label__twp Dólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill.
__label__twp “Listen!” cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room.
__label__twp All were silent.
__label__twp “I bet fifty imperials”—he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did not speak it very well—“I bet fifty imperials ...
__label__twp or do you wish to make it a hundred?” added he, addressing the Englishman.
__label__twp “No, fifty,” replied the latter.
__label__twp “All right.
__label__twp Fifty imperials ...
__label__twp that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot” (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) “and without holding on to anything.
__label__twp Is that right?”  “Quite right,” said the Englishman.
__label__twp Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was short—began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.
__label__twp “Wait!” cried Dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention.
__label__twp “Wait a bit, Kurágin.
__label__twp Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials.
__label__twp Do you understand?”  The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not.
__label__twp Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating Dólokhov’s words into English.
__label__twp A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and looked down.
__label__twp “Oh! Oh! Oh!” he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement.
__label__twp “Shut up!” cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window.
__label__twp The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.
__label__twp Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs.
__label__twp Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle.
__label__twp Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.
__label__twp Dólokhov’s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides.
__label__twp Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front.
__label__twp Pierre stood smiling but silent.
__label__twp One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dólokhov’s shirt.
__label__twp “I say, this is folly! He’ll be killed,” said this more sensible man.
__label__twp Anatole stopped him.
__label__twp “Don’t touch him! You’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed.
__label__twp Eh?...
__label__twp What then?...
__label__twp Eh?”  Dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his seat.
__label__twp “If anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, “I will throw him down there.
__label__twp Now then!”  Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself.
__label__twp One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from Dólokhov’s back.
__label__twp Anatole stood erect with staring eyes.
__label__twp The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips.
__label__twp The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall.
__label__twp Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear.
__label__twp All were still.
__label__twp Pierre took his hands from his eyes.
__label__twp Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort.
__label__twp The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back.
__label__twp “Why is it so long?” thought Pierre.
__label__twp It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.
__label__twp Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge.
__label__twp As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain.
__label__twp One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it.
__label__twp Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again.
__label__twp Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around.
__label__twp He looked up: Dólokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.
__label__twp “It’s empty.”  He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.
__label__twp Dólokhov jumped down.
__label__twp He smelt strongly of rum.
__label__twp “Well done!...
__label__twp Fine fellow!...
__label__twp There’s a bet for you!...
__label__twp Devil take you!” came from different sides.
__label__twp The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.
__label__twp Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak.
__label__twp Pierre jumped upon the window sill.
__label__twp “Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I’ll do the same thing!” he suddenly cried.
__label__twp “Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a bottle.
__label__twp I’ll do it....
__label__twp Bring a bottle!”  “Let him do it, let him do it,” said Dólokhov, smiling.
__label__twp “What next? Have you gone mad?...
__label__twp No one would let you!...
__label__twp Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,” exclaimed several voices.
__label__twp “I’ll drink it! Let’s have a bottle of rum!” shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window.
__label__twp They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying.
__label__twp “No, you’ll never manage him that way,” said Anatole.
__label__twp “Wait a bit and I’ll get round him....
__label__twp Listen! I’ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to ——’s.”  “Come on then,” cried Pierre.
__label__twp “Come on!...
__label__twp And we’ll take Bruin with us.”  And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it.
__label__twp CHAPTER X  Prince Vasíli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskáya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Borís on the evening of Anna Pávlovna’s soiree.
__label__twp The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Borís transferred into the regiment of Semënov Guards with the rank of cornet.
__label__twp He received, however, no appointment to Kutúzov’s staff despite all Anna Mikháylovna’s endeavors and entreaties.
__label__twp Soon after Anna Pávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time.
__label__twp The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivílov.
__label__twp It was St.
__label__twp Natalia’s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—the mother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly.
__label__twp Ever since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva’s big house on the Povarskáya, so well known to all Moscow.
__label__twp The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.
__label__twp The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve.
__label__twp A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect.
__label__twp Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors.
__label__twp The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors.
__label__twp The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.
__label__twp “I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,” or “ma chère”—he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, “my dear,” whether they were above or below him in rank—“I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping.
__label__twp But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma chère! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!” These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows.
__label__twp As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.
__label__twp Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dmítri Vasílevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: “Well, Dmítri, you’ll see that things are all as they should be? That’s right! The great thing is the serving, that’s it.” And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.
__label__twp “Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!” announced the countess’ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room.
__label__twp The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband’s portrait on it.
__label__twp “I’m quite worn out by these callers.
__label__twp However, I’ll see her and no more.
__label__twp She is so affected.
__label__twp Ask her in,” she said to the footman in a sad voice, as if saying: “Very well, finish me off.”  A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.
__label__twp “Dear Countess, what an age...
__label__twp She has been laid up, poor child ...
__label__twp at the Razumóvski’s ball ...
__label__twp and Countess Apráksina ...
__label__twp I was so delighted...” came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs.
__label__twp Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, “I am so delighted...
__label__twp Mamma’s health...
__label__twp and Countess Apráksina...” and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away.
__label__twp The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine’s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pávlovna’s reception.
__label__twp “I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor.
__label__twp “He is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!”  “What is that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bezúkhov’s distress some fifteen times.
__label__twp “That’s what comes of a modern education,” exclaimed the visitor.
__label__twp “It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.”  “You don’t say so!” replied the countess.
__label__twp “He chose his friends badly,” interposed Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp “Prince Vasíli’s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.
__label__twp Dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’s son sent back to Moscow.
__label__twp Anatole Kurágin’s father managed somehow to get his son’s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.”  “But what have they been up to?” asked the countess.
__label__twp “They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov,” replied the visitor.
__label__twp “He is a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal.
__label__twp And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!”  “What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!” shouted the count, dying with laughter.
__label__twp “Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?”  Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.
__label__twp “It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,” continued the visitor.
__label__twp “And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and clever.
__label__twp This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money.
__label__twp They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters to consider.”  “Why do you say this young man is so rich?” asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.
__label__twp “His children are all illegitimate.
__label__twp I think Pierre also is illegitimate.”  The visitor made a gesture with her hand.
__label__twp “I should think he has a score of them.”  Princess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.
__label__twp “The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly, and also in a half whisper, “everyone knows Count Cyril’s reputation....
__label__twp He has lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.”  “How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!” remarked the countess.
__label__twp “I have never seen a handsomer man.”  “He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp “Well, as I was saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death—and he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr.
__label__twp Lorrain has come from Petersburg—no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vasíli.
__label__twp Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasíli told me himself.
__label__twp Besides, Cyril Vladímirovich is my mother’s second cousin.
__label__twp He’s also my Bóry’s godfather,” she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the fact.
__label__twp “Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday.
__label__twp I hear he has come on some inspection business,” remarked the visitor.
__label__twp “Yes, but between ourselves,” said the princess, “that is a pretext.
__label__twp The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladímirovich, hearing how ill he is.”  “But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,” said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young ladies.
__label__twp “I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!”  And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well.
__label__twp “So do come and dine with us!” he said.
__label__twp CHAPTER XI  Silence ensued.
__label__twp The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave.
__label__twp The visitor’s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room.
__label__twp It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far.
__label__twp Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.
__label__twp The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.
__label__twp “Ah, here she is!” he exclaimed laughing.
__label__twp “My pet, whose name day it is.
__label__twp My dear pet!”  “Ma chère, there is a time for everything,” said the countess with feigned severity.
__label__twp “You spoil her, Ilyá,” she added, turning to her husband.
__label__twp “How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,” said the visitor.
__label__twp “What a charming child,” she added, addressing the mother.
__label__twp This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers—was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman.
__label__twp Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother’s mantilla—not paying the least attention to her severe remark—and began to laugh.
__label__twp She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.
__label__twp “Do you see?...
__label__twp My doll...
__label__twp Mimi...
__label__twp You see...” was all Natásha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny).
__label__twp She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.
__label__twp “Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,” said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: “She is my youngest girl.”  Natásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother’s mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.
__label__twp The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to take some part in it.
__label__twp “Tell me, my dear,” said she to Natásha, “is Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?”  Natásha did not like the visitor’s tone of condescension to childish things.
__label__twp She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.
__label__twp Meanwhile the younger generation: Borís, the officer, Anna Mikháylovna’s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count’s eldest son; Sónya, the count’s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Pétya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces.
__label__twp Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apráksina.
__label__twp Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.
__label__twp The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike.
__label__twp Borís was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features.
__label__twp Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.
__label__twp Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm.
__label__twp Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room.
__label__twp He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed.
__label__twp Borís on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull.
__label__twp Having said this he glanced at Natásha.
__label__twp She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her.
__label__twp Borís did not laugh.
__label__twp “You were meaning to go out, weren’t you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?” he asked his mother with a smile.
__label__twp “Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,” she answered, returning his smile.
__label__twp Borís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha.
__label__twp The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed.
__label__twp CHAPTER XII  The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countess’ eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were Nicholas and Sónya, the niece.
__label__twp Sónya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck.
__label__twp By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat.
__label__twp She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natásha and Borís, escape from the drawing room.
__label__twp “Ah yes, my dear,” said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, “his friend Borís has become an officer, and so for friendship’s sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my dear.
__label__twp And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn’t that friendship?” remarked the count in an inquiring tone.
__label__twp “But they say that war has been declared,” replied the visitor.
__label__twp “They’ve been saying so a long while,” said the count, “and they’ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it.
__label__twp My dear, there’s friendship for you,” he repeated.
__label__twp “He’s joining the hussars.”  The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.
__label__twp “It’s not at all from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion.
__label__twp “It is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.”  He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.
__label__twp “Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us today.
__label__twp He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.
__label__twp It can’t be helped!” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.
__label__twp “I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you don’t wish to let me go, I’ll stay.
__label__twp But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.—I don’t know how to hide what I feel.” As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sónya and the young lady visitor.
__label__twp The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.
__label__twp “All right, all right!” said the old count.
__label__twp “He always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor.
__label__twp Well, well, God grant it,” he added, not noticing his visitor’s sarcastic smile.
__label__twp The elders began talking about Bonaparte.
__label__twp Julie Karágina turned to young Rostóv.
__label__twp “What a pity you weren’t at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday.
__label__twp It was so dull without you,” said she, giving him a tender smile.
__label__twp The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sónya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally.
__label__twp In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her.
__label__twp She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room.
__label__twp All Nicholas’ animation vanished.
__label__twp He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sónya.
__label__twp “How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!” said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.
__label__twp “Cousinage—dangereux voisinage,” * she added.
__label__twp * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.
__label__twp “Yes,” said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, “and how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy.
__label__twp One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys.”  “It all depends on the bringing up,” remarked the visitor.
__label__twp “Yes, you’re quite right,” continued the countess.
__label__twp “Till now I have always, thank God, been my children’s friend and had their full confidence,” said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them.
__label__twp “I know I shall always be my daughters’ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can’t help it), he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.”  “Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,” chimed in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid.
__label__twp “Just fancy: wants to be an hussar.
__label__twp What’s one to do, my dear?”  “What a charming creature your younger girl is,” said the visitor; “a little volcano!”  “Yes, a regular volcano,” said the count.
__label__twp “Takes after me! And what a voice she has; though she’s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say she’ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give her lessons.”  “Isn’t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age.”  “Oh no, not at all too young!” replied the count.
__label__twp “Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.”  “And she’s in love with Borís already.
__label__twp Just fancy!” said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: “Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ...
__label__twp goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly” (she meant that they would be kissing), “but as it is, I know every word she utters.
__label__twp She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything.
__label__twp Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan.
__label__twp With her elder sister I was stricter.”  “Yes, I was brought up quite differently,” remarked the handsome elder daughter, Countess Véra, with a smile.
__label__twp But the smile did not enhance Véra’s beauty as smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression.
__label__twp Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone—the visitors and countess alike—turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.
__label__twp “People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,” said the visitor.
__label__twp “What’s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too clever with Véra,” said the count.
__label__twp “Well, what of that? She’s turned out splendidly all the same,” he added, winking at Véra.
__label__twp The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.
__label__twp “What manners! I thought they would never go,” said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.
__label__twp CHAPTER XIII  When Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory.
__label__twp There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room, waiting for Borís to come out.
__label__twp She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man’s discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly.
__label__twp At this Natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there.
__label__twp Borís paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face.
__label__twp Natásha, very still, peered out from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do.
__label__twp He stood a little while before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door.
__label__twp Natásha was about to call him but changed her mind.
__label__twp “Let him look for me,” thought she.
__label__twp Hardly had Borís gone than Sónya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the other door.
__label__twp Natásha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching—as under an invisible cap—to see what went on in the world.
__label__twp She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure.
__label__twp Sónya, muttering to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing room door.
__label__twp It opened and Nicholas came in.
__label__twp “Sónya, what is the matter with you? How can you?” said he, running up to her.
__label__twp “It’s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!” sobbed Sónya.
__label__twp “Ah, I know what it is.”  “Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!”  “Só-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?” said Nicholas taking her hand.
__label__twp Sónya did not pull it away, and left off crying.
__label__twp Natásha, not stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.
__label__twp “What will happen now?” thought she.
__label__twp “Sónya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are everything!” said Nicholas.
__label__twp “And I will prove it to you.”  “I don’t like you to talk like that.”  “Well, then, I won’t; only forgive me, Sónya!” He drew her to him and kissed her.
__label__twp “Oh, how nice,” thought Natásha; and when Sónya and Nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Borís to her.
__label__twp “Borís, come here,” said she with a sly and significant look.
__label__twp “I have something to tell you.
__label__twp Here, here!” and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.
__label__twp Borís followed her, smiling.
__label__twp “What is the something?” asked he.
__label__twp She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.
__label__twp “Kiss the doll,” said she.
__label__twp Borís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply.
__label__twp “Don’t you want to? Well, then, come here,” said she, and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll.
__label__twp “Closer, closer!” she whispered.
__label__twp She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face.
__label__twp “And me? Would you like to kiss me?” she whispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from excitement.
__label__twp Borís blushed.
__label__twp “How funny you are!” he said, bending down to her and blushing still more, but he waited and did nothing.
__label__twp Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.
__label__twp Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood, hanging her head.
__label__twp “Natásha,” he said, “you know that I love you, but....”  “You are in love with me?” Natásha broke in.
__label__twp “Yes, I am, but please don’t let us do like that....
__label__twp In another four years ...
__label__twp then I will ask for your hand.”  Natásha considered.
__label__twp “Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,” she counted on her slender little fingers.
__label__twp “All right! Then it’s settled?”  A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.
__label__twp “Settled!” replied Borís.
__label__twp “Forever?” said the little girl.
__label__twp “Till death itself?”  She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room.
__label__twp CHAPTER XIV  After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came “to congratulate.” The countess wished to have a tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikháylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.
__label__twp “With you I will be quite frank,” said Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp “There are not many left of us old friends! That’s why I so value your friendship.”  Anna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused.
__label__twp The countess pressed her friend’s hand.
__label__twp “Véra,” she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite, “how is it you have so little tact? Don’t you see you are not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...”  The handsome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.
__label__twp “If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,” she replied as she rose to go to her own room.
__label__twp But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, one pair at each window.
__label__twp She stopped and smiled scornfully.
__label__twp Sónya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the first he had ever written.
__label__twp Borís and Natásha were at the other window and ceased talking when Véra entered.
__label__twp Sónya and Natásha looked at Véra with guilty, happy faces.
__label__twp It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra.
__label__twp “How often have I asked you not to take my things?” she said.
__label__twp “You have a room of your own,” and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.
__label__twp “In a minute, in a minute,” he said, dipping his pen.
__label__twp “You always manage to do things at the wrong time,” continued Véra.
__label__twp “You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you.”  Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one replied, and the four simply looked at one another.
__label__twp She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand.
__label__twp “And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and Borís, or between you two? It’s all nonsense!”  “Now, Véra, what does it matter to you?” said Natásha in defense, speaking very gently.
__label__twp She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone.
__label__twp “Very silly,” said Véra.
__label__twp “I am ashamed of you.
__label__twp Secrets indeed!”  “All have secrets of their own,” answered Natásha, getting warmer.
__label__twp “We don’t interfere with you and Berg.”  “I should think not,” said Véra, “because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior.
__label__twp But I’ll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with Borís.”  “Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me,” remarked Borís.
__label__twp “I have nothing to complain of.”  “Don’t, Borís! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome,” said Natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.
__label__twp (She used the word “diplomat,” which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) “Why does she bother me?” And she added, turning to Véra, “You’ll never understand it, because you’ve never loved anyone.
__label__twp You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more” (this nickname, bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), “and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please,” she finished quickly.
__label__twp “I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...”  “Well, now you’ve done what you wanted,” put in Nicholas—“said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them.
__label__twp Let’s go to the nursery.”  All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.
__label__twp “The unpleasant things were said to me,” remarked Véra, “I said none to anyone.”  “Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!” shouted laughing voices through the door.
__label__twp The handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf.
__label__twp Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.
__label__twp In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
__label__twp “Ah, my dear,” said the countess, “my life is not all roses either.
__label__twp Don’t I know that at the rate we are living our means won’t last long? It’s all the Club and his easygoing nature.
__label__twp Even in the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But don’t let’s talk about me; tell me how you managed everything.
__label__twp I often wonder at you, Annette—how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It’s quite astonishing.
__label__twp How did you get things settled? I couldn’t possibly do it.”  “Ah, my love,” answered Anna Mikháylovna, “God grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction! One learns many things then,” she added with a certain pride.
__label__twp “That lawsuit taught me much.
__label__twp When I want to see one of those big people I write a note: ‘Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,’ and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times—till I get what I want.
__label__twp I don’t mind what they think of me.”  “Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?” asked the countess.
__label__twp “You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a cadet.
__label__twp There’s no one to interest himself for him.
__label__twp To whom did you apply?”  “To Prince Vasíli.
__label__twp He was so kind.
__label__twp He at once agreed to everything, and put the matter before the Emperor,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end.
__label__twp “Has Prince Vasíli aged much?” asked the countess.
__label__twp “I have not seen him since we acted together at the Rumyántsovs’ theatricals.
__label__twp I expect he has forgotten me.
__label__twp He paid me attentions in those days,” said the countess, with a smile.
__label__twp “He is just the same as ever,” replied Anna Mikháylovna, “overflowing with amiability.
__label__twp His position has not turned his head at all.
__label__twp He said to me, ‘I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess.
__label__twp I am at your command.’ Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation.
__label__twp But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,” continued Anna Mikháylovna, sadly, dropping her voice.
__label__twp “My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress.
__label__twp Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don’t know how to equip Borís.” She took out her handkerchief and began to cry.
__label__twp “I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble note.
__label__twp I am in such a state....
__label__twp My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov.
__label__twp If he will not assist his godson—you know he is Bóry’s godfather—and allow him something for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away....
__label__twp I shall not be able to equip him.”  The countess’ eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.
__label__twp “I often think, though, perhaps it’s a sin,” said the princess, “that here lives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all alone...
__label__twp that tremendous fortune...
__label__twp and what is his life worth? It’s a burden to him, and Bóry’s life is only just beginning....”  “Surely he will leave something to Borís,” said the countess.
__label__twp “Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.
__label__twp Still, I will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him straight out.
__label__twp Let people think what they will of me, it’s really all the same to me when my son’s fate is at stake.” The princess rose.
__label__twp “It’s now two o’clock and you dine at four.
__label__twp There will just be time.”  And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the anteroom with him.
__label__twp “Good-by, my dear,” said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, “Wish me good luck.”  “Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?” said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: “If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us.
__label__twp He has been to the house, you know, and danced with the children.
__label__twp Be sure to invite him, my dear.
__label__twp We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today.
__label__twp He says Count Orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be!”      CHAPTER XV  “My dear Borís,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as Countess Rostóva’s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s house.
__label__twp “My dear Borís,” said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son’s arm, “be affectionate and attentive to him.
__label__twp Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfather after all, and your future depends on him.
__label__twp Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to be.”  “If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it...” answered her son coldly.
__label__twp “But I have promised and will do it for your sake.”  Although the hall porter saw someone’s carriage standing at the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady’s old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.
__label__twp “We may as well go back,” said the son in French.
__label__twp “My dear!” exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.
__label__twp Borís said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak.
__label__twp “My friend,” said Anna Mikháylovna in gentle tones, addressing the hall porter, “I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is very ill...
__label__twp that’s why I have come...
__label__twp I am a relation.
__label__twp I shall not disturb him, my friend...
__label__twp I only need see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich: he is staying here, is he not? Please announce me.”  The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned away.
__label__twp “Princess Drubetskáya to see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich,” he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.
__label__twp The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.
__label__twp “My dear,” she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch, “you promised me!”  The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.
__label__twp They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince Vasíli.
__label__twp Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasíli came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast, as was his custom when at home—taking leave of a good-looking, dark-haired man.
__label__twp This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.
__label__twp “Then it is certain?” said the prince.
__label__twp “Prince, humanum est errare, * but...” replied the doctor, swallowing his r’s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.
__label__twp * To err is human.
__label__twp “Very well, very well...”  Seeing Anna Mikháylovna and her son, Prince Vasíli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry.
__label__twp The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother’s face, and he smiled slightly.
__label__twp “Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear invalid?” said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli stared at her and at Borís questioningly and perplexed.
__label__twp Borís bowed politely.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikháylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.
__label__twp “Is it possible?” exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp “Oh, how awful! It is terrible to think....
__label__twp This is my son,” she added, indicating Borís.
__label__twp “He wanted to thank you himself.”  Borís bowed again politely.
__label__twp “Believe me, Prince, a mother’s heart will never forget what you have done for us.”  “I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Schérer’s reception.
__label__twp “Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,” added he, addressing Borís with severity.
__label__twp “I am glad....
__label__twp Are you here on leave?” he went on in his usual tone of indifference.
__label__twp “I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,” replied Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince’s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.
__label__twp “Are you living with your mother?”  “I am living at Countess Rostóva’s,” replied Borís, again adding, “your excellency.”  “That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who married Nataly Shinshiná,” said Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp “I know, I know,” answered Prince Vasíli in his monotonous voice.
__label__twp “I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told.”  “But a very kind man, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved this censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man.
__label__twp “What do the doctors say?” asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again expressing deep sorrow.
__label__twp “They give little hope,” replied the prince.
__label__twp “And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and Borís.
__label__twp He is his godson,” she added, her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give Prince Vasíli much satisfaction.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezúkhov’s fortune, and hastened to reassure him.
__label__twp “If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,” said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, “I know his character: noble, upright ...
__label__twp but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses....
__label__twp They are still young....” She bent her head and continued in a whisper: “Has he performed his final duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.
__label__twp We women, Prince,” and she smiled tenderly, “always know how to say these things.
__label__twp I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me.
__label__twp I am used to suffering.”  Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna Pávlovna’s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp “Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikháylovna?” said he.
__label__twp “Let us wait until evening.
__label__twp The doctors are expecting a crisis.”  “But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake.
__label__twp Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...”  A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count’s niece, entered with a cold, stern face.
__label__twp The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli turned to her.
__label__twp “Well, how is he?”  “Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...” said the princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger.
__label__twp “Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count’s niece.
__label__twp “I have come, and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle.
__label__twp I imagine what you have gone through,” and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.
__label__twp The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as Anna Mikháylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasíli to take a seat beside her.
__label__twp “Borís,” she said to her son with a smile, “I shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don’t forget to give him the Rostóvs’ invitation.
__label__twp They ask him to dinner.
__label__twp I suppose he won’t go?” she continued, turning to the prince.
__label__twp “On the contrary,” replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed, “I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man....
__label__twp Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.”  He shrugged his shoulders.
__label__twp A footman conducted Borís down one flight of stairs and up another, to Pierre’s rooms.
__label__twp CHAPTER XVI  Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow.
__label__twp The story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was true.
__label__twp Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear.
__label__twp He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father’s house.
__label__twp Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father—who were never favorably disposed toward him—would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father’s part of the house.
__label__twp Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud.
__label__twp It was the eldest who was reading—the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier.
__label__twp Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper.
__label__twp The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw.
__label__twp She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.
__label__twp “How do you do, cousin?” said Pierre.
__label__twp “You don’t recognize me?”  “I recognize you only too well, too well.”  “How is the count? Can I see him?” asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed.
__label__twp “The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.”  “Can I see the count?” Pierre again asked.
__label__twp “Hm....
__label__twp If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him...
__label__twp Olga, go and see whether Uncle’s beef tea is ready—it is almost time,” she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.
__label__twp Olga went out.
__label__twp Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and said: “Then I will go to my rooms.
__label__twp You will let me know when I can see him.”  And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole.
__label__twp Next day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count’s house.
__label__twp He sent for Pierre and said to him: “My dear fellow, if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that is all I have to say to you.
__label__twp The count is very, very ill, and you must not see him at all.”  Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs.
__label__twp When Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.
__label__twp “England is done for,” said he, scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen.
__label__twp “Mr.
__label__twp Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man, is sentenced to...” But before Pierre—who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London—could pronounce Pitt’s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young officer entering his room.
__label__twp Pierre paused.
__label__twp He had left Moscow when Borís was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Borís by the hand with a friendly smile.
__label__twp “Do you remember me?” asked Borís quietly with a pleasant smile.
__label__twp “I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.”  “Yes, it seems he is ill.
__label__twp People are always disturbing him,” answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.
__label__twp Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.
__label__twp “Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today,” said he, after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.
__label__twp “Ah, Count Rostóv!” exclaimed Pierre joyfully.
__label__twp “Then you are his son, Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn’t know you at first.
__label__twp Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?...
__label__twp It’s such an age...”  “You are mistaken,” said Borís deliberately, with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile.
__label__twp “I am Borís, son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya.
__label__twp Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is Nicholas.
__label__twp I never knew any Madame Jacquot.”  Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.
__label__twp “Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I’ve mixed everything up.
__label__twp One has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course.
__label__twp Well, now we know where we are.
__label__twp And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the Channel.
__label__twp I think the expedition is quite feasible.
__label__twp If only Villeneuve doesn’t make a mess of things!”  Borís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve’s name.
__label__twp “We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics,” said he in his quiet ironical tone.
__label__twp “I know nothing about it and have not thought about it.
__label__twp Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip,” he continued.
__label__twp “Just now they are talking about you and your father.”  Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion’s sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.
__label__twp But Borís spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre’s eyes.
__label__twp “Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,” Borís went on.
__label__twp “Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...”  “Yes, it is all very horrid,” interrupted Pierre, “very horrid.”  Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself.
__label__twp “And it must seem to you,” said Borís flushing slightly, but not changing his tone or attitude, “it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man?”  “So it does,” thought Pierre.
__label__twp “But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people.
__label__twp We are very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your father is rich, I don’t regard myself as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.”  For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation.
__label__twp “Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I...
__label__twp who could think?...
__label__twp I know very well...”  But Borís again interrupted him.
__label__twp “I am glad I have spoken out fully.
__label__twp Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me,” said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him, “but I hope I have not offended you.
__label__twp I always make it a rule to speak out...
__label__twp Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the Rostóvs’?”  And Borís, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it, became quite pleasant again.
__label__twp “No, but I say,” said Pierre, calming down, “you are a wonderful fellow! What you have just said is good, very good.
__label__twp Of course you don’t know me.
__label__twp We have not met for such a long time...
__label__twp not since we were children.
__label__twp You might think that I...
__label__twp I understand, quite understand.
__label__twp I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it’s splendid.
__label__twp I am very glad to have made your acquaintance.
__label__twp It’s queer,” he added after a pause, “that you should have suspected me!” He began to laugh.
__label__twp “Well, what of it! I hope we’ll get better acquainted,” and he pressed Borís’ hand.
__label__twp “Do you know, I have not once been in to see the count.
__label__twp He has not sent for me....
__label__twp I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?”  “And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?” asked Borís with a smile.
__label__twp Pierre saw that Borís wished to change the subject, and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition.
__label__twp A footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going.
__label__twp Pierre, in order to make Borís’ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Borís’ eyes.
__label__twp After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man.
__label__twp As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli saw the princess off.
__label__twp She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful.
__label__twp “It is dreadful, dreadful!” she was saying, “but cost me what it may I shall do my duty.
__label__twp I will come and spend the night.
__label__twp He must not be left like this.
__label__twp Every moment is precious.
__label__twp I can’t think why his nieces put it off.
__label__twp Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!...
__label__twp Adieu, Prince! May God support you...”  “Adieu, ma bonne,” answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her.
__label__twp “Oh, he is in a dreadful state,” said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage.
__label__twp “He hardly recognizes anybody.”  “I don’t understand, Mamma—what is his attitude to Pierre?” asked the son.
__label__twp “The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.”  “But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?”  “Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!”  “Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...”  “Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!” exclaimed the mother.
__label__twp CHAPTER XVII  After Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov, Countess Rostóva sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes.
__label__twp At last she rang.
__label__twp “What is the matter with you, my dear?” she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes.
__label__twp “Don’t you wish to serve me? Then I’ll find you another place.”  The countess was upset by her friend’s sorrow and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid “my dear” and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness.
__label__twp “I am very sorry, ma’am,” answered the maid.
__label__twp “Ask the count to come to me.”  The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual.
__label__twp “Well, little countess? What a sauté of game au madère we are to have, my dear! I tasted it.
__label__twp The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás were not ill-spent.
__label__twp He is worth it!”  He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair.
__label__twp “What are your commands, little countess?”  “You see, my dear...
__label__twp What’s that mess?” she said, pointing to his waistcoat.
__label__twp “It’s the sauté, most likely,” she added with a smile.
__label__twp “Well, you see, Count, I want some money.”  Her face became sad.
__label__twp “Oh, little countess!” ...
__label__twp and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook.
__label__twp “I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,” and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband’s waistcoat.
__label__twp “Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who’s there?” he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons.
__label__twp “Send Dmítri to me!”  Dmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count’s house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.
__label__twp “This is what I want, my dear fellow,” said the count to the deferential young man who had entered.
__label__twp “Bring me...” he reflected a moment, “yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don’t bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess.”  “Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,” said the countess, sighing deeply.
__label__twp “When would you like them, your excellency?” asked Dmítri.
__label__twp “Allow me to inform you...
__label__twp But, don’t be uneasy,” he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger.
__label__twp “I was forgetting...
__label__twp Do you wish it brought at once?”  “Yes, yes; just so! Bring it.
__label__twp Give it to the countess.”  “What a treasure that Dmítri is,” added the count with a smile when the young man had departed.
__label__twp “There is never any ‘impossible’ with him.
__label__twp That’s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.”  “Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,” said the countess.
__label__twp “But I am in great need of this sum.”  “You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the count, and having kissed his wife’s hand he went back to his study.
__label__twp When Anna Mikháylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov’s the money, all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess’ little table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating her.
__label__twp “Well, my dear?” asked the countess.
__label__twp “Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...”  “Annette, for heaven’s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.
__label__twp “This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.”  Anna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping.
__label__twp The countess wept too.
__label__twp They wept because they were friends, and because they were kindhearted, and because they—friends from childhood—had to think about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....
__label__twp But those tears were pleasant to them both.
__label__twp CHAPTER XVIII  Countess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing room.
__label__twp The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes.
__label__twp From time to time he went out to ask: “Hasn’t she come yet?” They were expecting Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, known in society as le terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank plainness of speech.
__label__twp Márya Dmítrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less all without exception respected and feared her.
__label__twp In the count’s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting.
__label__twp None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it had appeared.
__label__twp The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking.
__label__twp He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.
__label__twp One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man.
__label__twp He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes.
__label__twp This was an old bachelor, Shinshín, a cousin of the countess’, a man with “a sharp tongue” as they said in Moscow society.
__label__twp He seemed to be condescending to his companion.
__label__twp The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings.
__label__twp This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semënov regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natásha had teased her elder sister Véra, speaking of Berg as her “intended.” The count sat between them and listened attentively.
__label__twp His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.
__label__twp “Well, then, old chap, mon très honorable Alphonse Kárlovich,” said Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a peculiarity of his speech.
__label__twp “Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l’état; * you want to make something out of your company?”       * You expect to make an income out of the government.
__label__twp “No, Peter Nikoláevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry.
__label__twp Just consider my own position now, Peter Nikoláevich...”  Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision.
__label__twp His conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself.
__label__twp He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.
__label__twp “Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich.
__label__twp Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty,” said he, looking at Shinshín and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else.
__label__twp “Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position,” continued Berg, “and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards.
__label__twp Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father,” he went on, emitting a smoke ring.
__label__twp “La balance y est...
__label__twp * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the proverb says,” remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count.
__label__twp * So that squares matters.
__label__twp The count burst out laughing.
__label__twp The other guests seeing that Shinshín was talking came up to listen.
__label__twp Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him.
__label__twp Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests.
__label__twp But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.
__label__twp “Well, my boy, you’ll get along wherever you go—foot or horse—that I’ll warrant,” said Shinshín, patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.
__label__twp Berg smiled joyously.
__label__twp The count, followed by his guests, went into the drawing room.
__label__twp It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests, expecting the summons to zakúska, * avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food.
__label__twp The host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are waiting for—some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready.
__label__twp * Hors d’oeuvres.
__label__twp Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across, blocking the way for everyone.
__label__twp The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables.
__label__twp He was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact.
__label__twp Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.
__label__twp “You have only lately arrived?” the countess asked him.
__label__twp “Oui, madame,” replied he, looking around him.
__label__twp “You have not yet seen my husband?”  “Non, madame.” He smiled quite inappropriately.
__label__twp “You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it’s very interesting.”  “Very interesting.”  The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables.
__label__twp The other guests were all conversing with one another.
__label__twp “The Razumóvskis...
__label__twp It was charming...
__label__twp You are very kind...
__label__twp Countess Apráksina...” was heard on all sides.
__label__twp The countess rose and went into the ballroom.
__label__twp “Márya Dmítrievna?” came her voice from there.
__label__twp “Herself,” came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya Dmítrievna entered the room.
__label__twp All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose.
__label__twp Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door.
__label__twp Tall and stout, holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up.
__label__twp Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian.
__label__twp “Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children,” she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all others.
__label__twp “Well, you old sinner,” she went on, turning to the count who was kissing her hand, “you’re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up,” and she pointed to the girls.
__label__twp “You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....”  “Well,” said she, “how’s my Cossack?” (Márya Dmítrievna always called Natásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child’s arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand.
__label__twp “I know she’s a scamp of a girl, but I like her.”  She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed with the pleasure of her saint’s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre.
__label__twp “Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,” said she, assuming a soft high tone of voice.
__label__twp “Come here, my friend...” and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher.
__label__twp Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles.
__label__twp “Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it’s my evident duty.” She paused.
__label__twp All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for this was clearly only a prelude.
__label__twp “A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!...
__label__twp His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.”  She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep from laughing.
__label__twp “Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?” said Márya Dmítrievna.
__label__twp The count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikháylovna with Shinshín.
__label__twp Berg gave his arm to Véra.
__label__twp The smiling Julie Karágina went in with Nicholas.
__label__twp After them other couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses followed singly.
__label__twp The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their places.
__label__twp Then the strains of the count’s household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen.
__label__twp At one end of the table sat the countess with Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna Mikháylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down.
__label__twp At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and the other male visitors on his right.
__label__twp Midway down the long table on one side sat the grown-up young people: Véra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Borís; and on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses.
__label__twp From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors’ glasses, not neglecting his own.
__label__twp The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair.
__label__twp At the ladies’ end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men’s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests.
__label__twp Berg with tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling.
__label__twp Borís was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha, who was sitting opposite.
__label__twp Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal.
__label__twp Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.
__label__twp These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the next man’s shoulders and whispered: “Dry Madeira”...
__label__twp “Hungarian”...
__label__twp or “Rhine wine” as the case might be.
__label__twp Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count’s monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests.
__label__twp Natásha, who sat opposite, was looking at Borís as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time.
__label__twp Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl’s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why.
__label__twp Nicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile.
__label__twp Sónya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another.
__label__twp The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children.
__label__twp The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by.
__label__twp He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.
__label__twp CHAPTER XIX  At the men’s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated.
__label__twp The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.
__label__twp “And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?” remarked Shinshín.
__label__twp “He has stopped Austria’s cackle and I fear it will be our turn next.”  The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to the service and patriotically Russian.
__label__twp He resented Shinshín’s remark.
__label__twp “It is for the reasson, my goot sir,” said he, speaking with a German accent, “for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat.
__label__twp He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances...” he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.
__label__twp Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:  ...
__label__twp and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor’s sole and absolute aim—to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations—has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose.
__label__twp “Zat, my dear sir, is vy...” he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.
__label__twp “Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* ‘Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn spindles at home!’?” said Shinshín, puckering his brows and smiling.
__label__twp “Cela nous convient à merveille.*(2) Suvórov now—he knew what he was about; yet they beat him à plate couture,*(3) and where are we to find Suvórovs now? Je vous demande un peu,” *(4) said he, continually changing from French to Russian.
__label__twp *Do you know the proverb?       *(2) That suits us down to the ground.
__label__twp *(3) Hollow.
__label__twp *(4) I just ask you that.
__label__twp “Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!” said the colonel, thumping the table; “and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill pe vell.
__label__twp And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible”...
__label__twp he dwelt particularly on the word possible...
__label__twp “as po-o-ossible,” he ended, again turning to the count.
__label__twp “Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere’s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it?” he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.
__label__twp “I am quite of your opinion,” replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger.
__label__twp “I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,” he concluded, conscious—as were others—after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward.
__label__twp “What you said just now was splendid!” said his partner Julie.
__label__twp Sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.
__label__twp Pierre listened to the colonel’s speech and nodded approvingly.
__label__twp “That’s fine,” said he.
__label__twp “The young man’s a real hussar!” shouted the colonel, again thumping the table.
__label__twp “What are you making such a noise about over there?” Márya Dmítrievna’s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table.
__label__twp “What are you thumping the table for?” she demanded of the hussar, “and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?”  “I am speaking ze truce,” replied the hussar with a smile.
__label__twp “It’s all about the war,” the count shouted down the table.
__label__twp “You know my son’s going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going.”  “I have four sons in the army but still I don’t fret.
__label__twp It is all in God’s hands.
__label__twp You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,” replied Márya Dmítrievna’s deep voice, which easily carried the whole length of the table.
__label__twp “That’s true!”  Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies’ at the one end and the men’s at the other.
__label__twp “You won’t ask,” Natásha’s little brother was saying; “I know you won’t ask!”  “I will,” replied Natásha.
__label__twp Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution.
__label__twp She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother:  “Mamma!” rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice, audible the whole length of the table.
__label__twp “What is it?” asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter’s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.
__label__twp The conversation was hushed.
__label__twp “Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” and Natásha’s voice sounded still more firm and resolute.
__label__twp The countess tried to frown, but could not.
__label__twp Márya Dmítrievna shook her fat finger.
__label__twp “Cossack!” she said threateningly.
__label__twp Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the elders.
__label__twp “You had better take care!” said the countess.
__label__twp “Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” Natásha again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good part.
__label__twp Sónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter.
__label__twp “You see! I have asked,” whispered Natásha to her little brother and to Pierre, glancing at him again.
__label__twp “Ice pudding, but you won’t get any,” said Márya Dmítrievna.
__label__twp Natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Márya Dmítrievna.
__label__twp “Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don’t like ice cream.”  “Carrot ices.”  “No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?” she almost screamed; “I want to know!”  Márya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in.
__label__twp Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna’s answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion.
__label__twp Natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice.
__label__twp Before the ices, champagne was served round.
__label__twp The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, went up to “congratulate” the countess, and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another.
__label__twp Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count’s study.
__label__twp CHAPTER XX  The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count’s visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the sitting room, some in the library.
__label__twp The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything.
__label__twp The young people, at the countess’ instigation, gathered round the clavichord and harp.
__label__twp Julie by general request played first.
__label__twp After she had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natásha and Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing something.
__label__twp Natásha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.
__label__twp “What shall we sing?” she said.
__label__twp “‘The Brook,’” suggested Nicholas.
__label__twp “Well, then, let’s be quick.
__label__twp Borís, come here,” said Natásha.
__label__twp “But where is Sónya?”  She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her.
__label__twp Running into Sónya’s room and not finding her there, Natásha ran to the nursery, but Sónya was not there either.
__label__twp Natásha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage.
__label__twp The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv household.
__label__twp And there in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse’s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook.
__label__twp Natásha’s face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint’s day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.
__label__twp “Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?...
__label__twp Oo...
__label__twp Oo...
__label__twp Oo...!” And Natásha’s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya was crying.
__label__twp Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed.
__label__twp Natásha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend.
__label__twp With an effort Sónya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.
__label__twp “Nicholas is going away in a week’s time, his...
__label__twp papers...
__label__twp have come...
__label__twp he told me himself...
__label__twp but still I should not cry,” and she showed a paper she held in her hand—with the verses Nicholas had written, “still, I should not cry, but you can’t...
__label__twp no one can understand...
__label__twp what a soul he has!”  And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.
__label__twp “It’s all very well for you...
__label__twp I am not envious...
__label__twp I love you and Borís also,” she went on, gaining a little strength; “he is nice...
__label__twp there are no difficulties in your way....
__label__twp But Nicholas is my cousin...
__label__twp one would have to...
__label__twp the Metropolitan himself...
__label__twp and even then it can’t be done.
__label__twp And besides, if she tells Mamma” (Sónya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so) “that I am spoiling Nicholas’ career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly...
__label__twp God is my witness,” and she made the sign of the cross, “I love her so much, and all of you, only Véra...
__label__twp And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing....”  Sónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed.
__label__twp Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend’s trouble.
__label__twp “Sónya,” she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend’s sorrow, “I’m sure Véra has said something to you since dinner? Hasn’t she?”  “Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and she found them on my table and said she’d show them to Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me, but that he’ll marry Julie.
__label__twp You see how he’s been with her all day...
__label__twp Natásha, what have I done to deserve it?...”  And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before.
__label__twp Natásha lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her.
__label__twp “Sónya, don’t believe her, darling! Don’t believe her! Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be.
__label__twp I don’t quite remember how, but don’t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? There’s Uncle Shinshín’s brother has married his first cousin.
__label__twp And we are only second cousins, you know.
__label__twp And Borís says it is quite possible.
__label__twp You know I have told him all about it.
__label__twp And he is so clever and so good!” said Natásha.
__label__twp “Don’t you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!” and she kissed her and laughed.
__label__twp “Véra’s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she won’t say anything to Mamma.
__label__twp Nicholas will tell her himself, and he doesn’t care at all for Julie.”  Natásha kissed her on the hair.
__label__twp Sónya sat up.
__label__twp The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.
__label__twp “Do you think so?...
__label__twp Really? Truly?” she said, quickly smoothing her frock and hair.
__label__twp “Really, truly!” answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend’s plaits.
__label__twp Both laughed.
__label__twp “Well, let’s go and sing ‘The Brook.’”  “Come along!”  “Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!” said Natásha, stopping suddenly.
__label__twp “I feel so happy!”  And she set off at a run along the passage.
__label__twp Sónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after Natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light, joyous steps.
__label__twp At the visitors’ request the young people sang the quartette, “The Brook,” with which everyone was delighted.
__label__twp Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:     At nighttime in the moon’s fair glow      How sweet, as fancies wander free,    To feel that in this world there’s one      Who still is thinking but of thee!     That while her fingers touch the harp      Wafting sweet music o’er the lea,    It is for thee thus swells her heart,      Sighing its message out to thee...
__label__twp A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,      But oh! till then I cannot live!...
__label__twp He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.
__label__twp Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre.
__label__twp When the music began Natásha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and blushing:  “Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.”  “I am afraid of mixing the figures,” Pierre replied; “but if you will be my teacher...” And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl.
__label__twp While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up, Pierre sat down with his little partner.
__label__twp Natásha was perfectly happy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad.
__label__twp She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.
__label__twp She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold.
__label__twp Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan.
__label__twp “Dear, dear! Just look at her!” exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natásha.
__label__twp Natásha blushed and laughed.
__label__twp “Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?”   In the midst of the third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya Dmítrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors.
__label__twp They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom.
__label__twp First came Márya Dmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances.
__label__twp The count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Márya Dmítrievna.
__label__twp He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the écossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:  “Semën! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?”  This was the count’s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.
__label__twp (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)  “Look at Papa!” shouted Natásha to the whole company, and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.
__label__twp And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, Márya Dmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what was to follow.
__label__twp As soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs—the men on one side and the women on the other—who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.
__label__twp “Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!” loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.
__label__twp The count danced well and knew it.
__label__twp But his partner could not and did not want to dance well.
__label__twp Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance.
__label__twp What was expressed by the whole of the count’s plump figure, in Márya Dmítrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.
__label__twp But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Márya Dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions—the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot—which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity.
__label__twp The dance grew livelier and livelier.
__label__twp The other couples could not attract a moment’s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so.
__label__twp All were watching the count and Márya Dmítrievna.
__label__twp Natásha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to “look at Papa!” though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple.
__label__twp In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster.
__label__twp Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by Natásha.
__label__twp Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.
__label__twp “That’s how we used to dance in our time, ma chère,” said the count.
__label__twp “That was a Daniel Cooper!” exclaimed Márya Dmítrievna, tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily.
__label__twp CHAPTER XXI  While in the Rostóvs’ ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezúkhov had a sixth stroke.
__label__twp The doctors pronounced recovery impossible.
__label__twp After a mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments.
__label__twp Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral.
__label__twp The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the count’s health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine’s court, Count Bezúkhov.
__label__twp The magnificent reception room was crowded.
__label__twp Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in low tones.
__label__twp When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand.
__label__twp After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.
__label__twp Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man’s room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.
__label__twp “The limits of human life ...
__label__twp are fixed and may not be o’erpassed,” said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naïvely to his words.
__label__twp “I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?” asked the lady, adding the priest’s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject.
__label__twp “Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament,” replied the priest, passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head.
__label__twp “Who was that? The Military Governor himself?” was being asked at the other side of the room.
__label__twp “How young-looking he is!”  “Yes, and he is over sixty.
__label__twp I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone.
__label__twp They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.”  “I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.”  The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr.
__label__twp Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.
__label__twp “Beautiful,” said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather.
__label__twp “The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow one feels as if one were in the country.”  “Yes, indeed,” replied the princess with a sigh.
__label__twp “So he may have something to drink?”  Lorrain considered.
__label__twp “Has he taken his medicine?”  “Yes.”  The doctor glanced at his watch.
__label__twp “Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,” and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.
__label__twp “Dere has neffer been a gase,” a German doctor was saying to an aide-de-camp, “dat one liffs after de sird stroke.”  “And what a well-preserved man he was!” remarked the aide-de-camp.
__label__twp “And who will inherit his wealth?” he added in a whisper.
__label__twp “It von’t go begging,” replied the German with a smile.
__label__twp Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain’s instructions.
__label__twp The German doctor went up to Lorrain.
__label__twp “Do you think he can last till morning?” asked the German, addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.
__label__twp Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before his nose.
__label__twp “Tonight, not later,” said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient’s condition.
__label__twp Meanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess’ room.
__label__twp In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.
__label__twp The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and little tables.
__label__twp The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just visible behind a screen.
__label__twp A small dog began to bark.
__label__twp “Ah, is it you, cousin?”  She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish.
__label__twp “Has anything happened?” she asked.
__label__twp “I am so terrified.”  “No, there is no change.
__label__twp I only came to have a talk about business, Catiche,” * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated.
__label__twp “You have made the place warm, I must say,” he remarked.
__label__twp “Well, sit down: let’s have a talk.”       *Catherine.
__label__twp “I thought perhaps something had happened,” she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she prepared to listen.
__label__twp “I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can’t.”  “Well, my dear?” said Prince Vasíli, taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit.
__label__twp It was plain that this “well?” referred to much that they both understood without naming.
__label__twp The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes.
__label__twp Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh.
__label__twp This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness.
__label__twp “And I?” he said; “do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very serious talk.”  Prince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room.
__label__twp His eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm.
__label__twp The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasíli’s eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.
__label__twp “Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semënovna,” continued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme, apparently not without an inner struggle; “at such a moment as this one must think of everything.
__label__twp One must think of the future, of all of you...
__label__twp I love you all, like children of my own, as you know.”  The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same dull expression.
__label__twp “And then of course my family has also to be considered,” Prince Vasíli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her.
__label__twp “You know, Catiche, that we—you three sisters, Mámontov, and my wife—are the count’s only direct heirs.
__label__twp I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters.
__label__twp It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything.
__label__twp Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,” pointing to his portrait, “definitely demanded that he should be called.”  Prince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him.
__label__twp “There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,” she replied, “and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this...”  “Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away.
__label__twp “But...
__label__twp in short, the fact is...
__label__twp you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.”  “He has made wills enough!” quietly remarked the princess.
__label__twp “But he cannot leave the estate to Pierre.
__label__twp Pierre is illegitimate.”  “But, my dear,” said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: “what if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre’s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the count’s services, his request would be granted?...”  The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.
__label__twp “I can tell you more,” continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand, “that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it.
__label__twp The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is over,” and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over, “and the count’s papers are opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly be granted.
__label__twp Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.”  “And our share?” asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything might happen, only not that.
__label__twp “But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the legal heir to everything and you won’t get anything.
__label__twp You must know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed or not.
__label__twp And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...”  “What next?” the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes.
__label__twp “I am a woman, and you think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...
__label__twp un bâtard!”* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of his contention.
__label__twp * A bastard.
__label__twp “Well, really, Catiche! Can’t you understand! You are so intelligent, how is it you don’t see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezúkhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s’ensuit!* That’s certain.”       * And all that follows therefrom.
__label__twp “I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,” said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging.
__label__twp “My dear Princess Catherine Semënovna,” began Prince Vasíli impatiently, “I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation.
__label__twp And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre’s favor are among the count’s papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don’t believe me, then believe an expert.
__label__twp I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich” (the family solicitor) “and he says the same.”  At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess’ ideas; her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect.
__label__twp “That would be a fine thing!” said she.
__label__twp “I never wanted anything and I don’t now.”  She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.
__label__twp “And this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake!” she cried.
__label__twp “It’s splendid! Fine! I don’t want anything, Prince.”  “Yes, but you are not the only one.
__label__twp There are your sisters...” replied Prince Vasíli.
__label__twp But the princess did not listen to him.
__label__twp “Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten.
__label__twp I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude—the blackest ingratitude—in this house...”  “Do you or do you not know where that will is?” insisted Prince Vasíli, his cheeks twitching more than ever.
__label__twp “Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and sacrificed myself.
__label__twp But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has been intriguing!”  The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand.
__label__twp She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.
__label__twp She gave her companion an angry glance.
__label__twp “There is still time, my dear.
__label__twp You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten.
__label__twp Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...”  “Who sacrificed everything for him,” chimed in the princess, who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, “though he never could appreciate it.
__label__twp No, mon cousin,” she added with a sigh, “I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice.
__label__twp In this world one has to be cunning and cruel.”  “Now come, come! Be reasonable.
__label__twp I know your excellent heart.”  “No, I have a wicked heart.”  “I know your heart,” repeated the prince.
__label__twp “I value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me.
__label__twp Don’t upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an hour....
__label__twp Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where it is.
__label__twp You must know.
__label__twp We will take it at once and show it to the count.
__label__twp He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.
__label__twp You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes; that is my only reason for being here.
__label__twp I came simply to help him and you.”  “Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing—I know!” cried the princess.
__label__twp “That’s not the point, my dear.”  “It’s that protégé of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskáya, that Anna Mikháylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid...
__label__twp the infamous, vile woman!”  “Do not let us lose any time...”  “Ah, don’t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about Sophie—I can’t repeat them—that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight.
__label__twp I know it was then he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.”  “We’ve got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it sooner?”  “It’s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,” said the princess, ignoring his question.
__label__twp “Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!” almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed.
__label__twp “And what does she come worming herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind.
__label__twp The time will come!”      CHAPTER XXII  While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess’ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikháylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving into the court of Count Bezúkhov’s house.
__label__twp As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikháylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up.
__label__twp Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikháylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him.
__label__twp He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door.
__label__twp While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall.
__label__twp Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.
__label__twp But neither Anna Mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them.
__label__twp “It seems to be all right,” Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow.
__label__twp Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna’s air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary.
__label__twp Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering.
__label__twp These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.
__label__twp “Is this the way to the princesses’ apartments?” asked Anna Mikháylovna of one of them.
__label__twp “Yes,” replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now permissible; “the door to the left, ma’am.”  “Perhaps the count did not ask for me,” said Pierre when he reached the landing.
__label__twp “I’d better go to my own room.”  Anna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up.
__label__twp “Ah, my friend!” she said, touching his arm as she had done her son’s when speaking to him that afternoon, “believe me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!”  “But really, hadn’t I better go away?” he asked, looking kindly at her over his spectacles.
__label__twp “Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you.
__label__twp Think that he is your father ...
__label__twp perhaps in the agony of death.” She sighed.
__label__twp “I have loved you like a son from the first.
__label__twp Trust yourself to me, Pierre.
__label__twp I shall not forget your interests.”  Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikháylovna who was already opening a door.
__label__twp This door led into a back anteroom.
__label__twp An old man, a servant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking.
__label__twp Pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as “my dear” and “my sweet,” asked about the princess’ health and then led Pierre along a stone passage.
__label__twp The first door on the left led into the princesses’ apartments.
__label__twp The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking.
__label__twp Seeing them pass, Prince Vasíli drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.
__label__twp This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince Vasíli’s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.
__label__twp “Be a man, my friend.
__label__twp I will look after your interests,” said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.
__label__twp Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what “watching over his interests” meant, but he decided that all these things had to be.
__label__twp From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count’s reception room.
__label__twp It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet.
__label__twp They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them.
__label__twp They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great.
__label__twp The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one another.
__label__twp All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikháylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna’s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived.
__label__twp With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon.
__label__twp She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured.
__label__twp Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count’s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest.
__label__twp “God be thanked that you are in time,” said she to one of the priests; “all we relatives have been in such anxiety.
__label__twp This young man is the count’s son,” she added more softly.
__label__twp “What a terrible moment!”  Having said this she went up to the doctor.
__label__twp “Dear doctor,” said she, “this young man is the count’s son.
__label__twp Is there any hope?”  The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from the doctor to Pierre.
__label__twp To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice, she said:  “Trust in His mercy!” and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.
__label__twp Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved toward the sofa she had indicated.
__label__twp As soon as Anna Mikháylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy.
__label__twp He noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility.
__label__twp A deference such as he had never before received was shown him.
__label__twp A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him.
__label__twp At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services.
__label__twp He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady’s chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.
__label__twp Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect majestically entered the room.
__label__twp He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast.
__label__twp He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre.
__label__twp He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on.
__label__twp “Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you.
__label__twp That is well!” and he turned to go.
__label__twp But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: “How is...” and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man “the count,” yet ashamed to call him “father.”  “He had another stroke about half an hour ago.
__label__twp Courage, my friend...”  Pierre’s mind was in such a confused state that the word “stroke” suggested to him a blow from something.
__label__twp He looked at Prince Vasíli in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe.
__label__twp He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step.
__label__twp The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.
__label__twp Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last Anna Mikháylovna, still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said:  “The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered.
__label__twp Come.”  Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room.
__label__twp CHAPTER XXIII  Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets.
__label__twp The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service.
__label__twp Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw—covered to the waist by a bright green quilt—the familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezúkhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face.
__label__twp He lay just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt.
__label__twp Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position.
__label__twp By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service.
__label__twp A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the strange lady.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead.
__label__twp His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God.
__label__twp “If you do not understand these sentiments,” he seemed to be saying, “so much the worse for you!”  Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants; the men and women had separated as in church.
__label__twp All were silently crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper.
__label__twp He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.
__label__twp Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole, watched him.
__label__twp She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh.
__label__twp She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns.
__label__twp In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count’s hand got up and said something to the ladies.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back.
__label__twp The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it.
__label__twp He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment.
__label__twp The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service continued.
__label__twp During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli left the chair on which he had been leaning, and—with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them—did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings.
__label__twp On leaving the bed both Prince Vasíli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded.
__label__twp Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential.
__label__twp The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament.
__label__twp The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before.
__label__twp Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which Anna Mikháylovna’s was the most distinct.
__label__twp Pierre heard her say:  “Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be impossible...”  The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane—which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service.
__label__twp He judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.
__label__twp “Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper.
__label__twp “Catch hold from underneath.
__label__twp Here!” exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them.
__label__twp As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man’s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly, leonine head.
__label__twp This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death.
__label__twp It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg.
__label__twp But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.
__label__twp After a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had carried the sick man dispersed.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna touched Pierre’s hand and said, “Come.” Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed.
__label__twp He lay with his head propped high on the pillows.
__label__twp His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward.
__label__twp When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man.
__label__twp Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too much.
__label__twp Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man’s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss.
__label__twp Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand.
__label__twp Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count’s face stirred.
__label__twp Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was to do next.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed.
__label__twp Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly.
__label__twp Again Pierre fell into the naïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible.
__label__twp He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierre’s face had been before he sat down.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son.
__label__twp This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour.
__label__twp Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count’s face began to twitch.
__label__twp The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick man’s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasíli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt.
__label__twp The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience.
__label__twp He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed.
__label__twp “Wants to turn on the other side,” whispered the servant, and got up to turn the count’s heavy body toward the wall.
__label__twp Pierre rose to help him.
__label__twp While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward.
__label__twp Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre’s terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness.
__label__twp At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes.
__label__twp The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall.
__label__twp He sighed.
__label__twp “He is dozing,” said Anna Mikháylovna, observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching.
__label__twp “Let us go.”  Pierre went out.
__label__twp CHAPTER XXIV  There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly.
__label__twp As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered:  “I can’t bear the sight of that woman.”  “Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,” said Prince Vasíli to Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp “Go and take something, my poor Anna Mikháylovna, or you will not hold out.”  To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder.
__label__twp Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small drawing room.
__label__twp “There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea,” Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room.
__label__twp Around the table all who were at Count Bezúkhov’s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves.
__label__twp Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables.
__label__twp During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times.
__label__twp Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles.
__label__twp On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom.
__label__twp Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to.
__label__twp He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess.
__label__twp Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a short interval followed her.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.
__label__twp “Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not necessary,” said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.
__label__twp “But, my dear princess,” answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing, “won’t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared...”  Prince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with one leg crossed high above the other.
__label__twp His cheeks, which were so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying.
__label__twp “Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases.
__label__twp You know how fond the count is of her.”  “I don’t even know what is in this paper,” said the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand.
__label__twp “All I know is that his real will is in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....”  She tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar her path.
__label__twp “I know, my dear, kind princess,” said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.
__label__twp “Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous en conjure...”  The princess did not reply.
__label__twp Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness.
__label__twp “Pierre, my dear, come here.
__label__twp I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation; is it not so, Prince?”  “Why don’t you speak, cousin?” suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled.
__label__twp “Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man’s room? Intriguer!” she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.
__label__twp But Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio, and changed her grip.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli rose.
__label__twp “Oh!” said he with reproach and surprise, “this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.”  The princess let go.
__label__twp “And you too!”  But Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him.
__label__twp “Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility.
__label__twp I myself will go and ask him, I!...
__label__twp does that satisfy you?”  “But, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna, “after such a solemn sacrament, allow him a moment’s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion,” said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasíli.
__label__twp “Remember that you will answer for the consequences,” said Prince Vasíli severely.
__label__twp “You don’t know what you are doing.”  “Vile woman!” shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.
__label__twp At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands.
__label__twp “What are you doing!” she cried vehemently.
__label__twp “He is dying and you leave me alone with him!”  Her sister dropped the portfolio.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna, stooping, quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom.
__label__twp The eldest princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves, followed her.
__label__twp A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again biting her underlip.
__label__twp At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred.
__label__twp “Yes, now you may be glad!” said she; “this is what you have been waiting for.” And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room.
__label__twp Prince Vasíli came next.
__label__twp He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand.
__label__twp Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague.
__label__twp “Ah, my friend!” said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before.
__label__twp “How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear friend...
__label__twp I too...
__label__twp All will end in death, all! Death is awful...” and he burst into tears.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna came out last.
__label__twp She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps.
__label__twp “Pierre!” she said.
__label__twp Pierre gave her an inquiring look.
__label__twp She kissed the young man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears.
__label__twp Then after a pause she said:  “He is no more....”  Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.
__label__twp “Come, I will go with you.
__label__twp Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.”  She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face.
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm.
__label__twp In the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre:  “Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.
__label__twp But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune.
__label__twp The will has not yet been opened.
__label__twp I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.”  Pierre was silent.
__label__twp “Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Borís.
__label__twp But he had no time.
__label__twp I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father’s wish?”  Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikháylovna.
__label__twp After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs’ and went to bed.
__label__twp On waking in the morning she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezúkhov’s death.
__label__twp She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying.
__label__twp As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments—the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father.
__label__twp “It is painful, but it does one good.
__label__twp It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,” said she.
__label__twp Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasíli she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.
__label__twp CHAPTER XXV  At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andréevich Bolkónski’s estate, the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince’s household.
__label__twp General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich (nicknamed in society, “the King of Prussia”) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne.
__label__twp Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing.
__label__twp He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice—idleness and superstition, and only two virtues—activity and intelligence.
__label__twp He himself undertook his daughter’s education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied.
__label__twp He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate.
__label__twp As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude.
__label__twp He always came to table under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute.
__label__twp With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused.
__label__twp Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the prince’s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour.
__label__twp Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes.
__label__twp On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer.
__label__twp Every morning she came in like that, and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.
__label__twp An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper: “Please walk in.”  Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe.
__label__twp The princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily.
__label__twp She paused at the entrance.
__label__twp The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work.
__label__twp The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.
__label__twp The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around—all indicated continuous, varied, and orderly activity.
__label__twp The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age.
__label__twp After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter.
__label__twp He never gave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively, said severely:  “Quite well? All right then, sit down.” He took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot.
__label__twp “For tomorrow!” said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.
__label__twp The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.
__label__twp “Wait a bit, here’s a letter for you,” said the old man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in a woman’s hand from a bag hanging above the table, onto which he threw it.
__label__twp At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess’ face.
__label__twp She took it quickly and bent her head over it.
__label__twp “From Héloïse?” asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound, yellowish teeth.
__label__twp “Yes, it’s from Julie,” replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile.
__label__twp “I’ll let two more letters pass, but the third I’ll read,” said the prince sternly; “I’m afraid you write much nonsense.
__label__twp I’ll read the third!”  “Read this if you like, Father,” said the princess, blushing still more and holding out the letter.
__label__twp “The third, I said the third!” cried the prince abruptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figures.
__label__twp “Well, madam,” he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco, which she had known so long.
__label__twp “Now, madam, these triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...”  The princess looked in a scared way at her father’s eyes glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father’s further explanations, however clear they might be.
__label__twp Whether it was the teacher’s fault or the pupil’s, this same thing happened every day: the princess’ eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern father’s withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace.
__label__twp The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.
__label__twp The princess gave a wrong answer.
__label__twp “Well now, isn’t she a fool!” shouted the prince, pushing the book aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and down, lightly touched his daughter’s hair and sat down again.
__label__twp He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.
__label__twp “This won’t do, Princess; it won’t do,” said he, when Princess Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day’s lesson, was about to leave: “Mathematics are most important, madam! I don’t want to have you like our silly ladies.
__label__twp Get used to it and you’ll like it,” and he patted her cheek.
__label__twp “It will drive all the nonsense out of your head.”  She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk.
__label__twp “Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Héloïse has sent you.
__label__twp Religious! I don’t interfere with anyone’s belief...
__label__twp I have looked at it.
__label__twp Take it.
__label__twp Well, now go.
__label__twp Go.”  He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.
__label__twp Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer.
__label__twp She sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers.
__label__twp The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy.
__label__twp She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter.
__label__twp It was from her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Karágina who had been at the Rostóvs’ name-day party.
__label__twp Julie wrote in French:  Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted.
__label__twp Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?  Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right.
__label__twp It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin face.
__label__twp Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass.
__label__twp “She flatters me,” thought the princess, turning away and continuing to read.
__label__twp But Julie did not flatter her friend, the princess’ eyes—large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)—were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty.
__label__twp But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes—the look they had when she was not thinking of herself.
__label__twp As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass.
__label__twp She went on reading:  All Moscow talks of nothing but war.
__label__twp One of my two brothers is already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march to the frontier.
__label__twp Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war.
__label__twp God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart.
__label__twp I mean young Nicholas Rostóv, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army.
__label__twp I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me.
__label__twp This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and has so much heart.
__label__twp He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.
__label__twp Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.
__label__twp That is still too fresh.
__label__twp Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows.
__label__twp You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed.
__label__twp But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old Count Bezúkhov, and his inheritance.
__label__twp Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vasíli nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezúkhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia.
__label__twp It is rumored that Prince Vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.
__label__twp I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezúkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow.
__label__twp As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don’t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezúkhova.
__label__twp But you will understand that I have no desire for the post.
__label__twp À propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikháylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you.
__label__twp It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasíli’s son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguée, and it is on you that his relations’ choice has fallen.
__label__twp I don’t know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it.
__label__twp He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace.
__label__twp That is all I have been able to find out about him.
__label__twp But enough of gossip.
__label__twp I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins’.
__label__twp Read the mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here.
__label__twp Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul.
__label__twp Adieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
__label__twp I embrace you as I love you.
__label__twp JULIE  P.S.
__label__twp Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.
__label__twp The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed.
__label__twp Then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table.
__label__twp She took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it.
__label__twp This is the reply she wrote, also in French:  Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great delight.
__label__twp So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect on you.
__label__twp You complain of our separation.
__label__twp What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad.
__label__twp Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man? On such matters I am only severe with myself.
__label__twp I understand such feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of them, neither do I condemn them.
__label__twp Only it seems to me that Christian love, love of one’s neighbor, love of one’s enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.
__label__twp The news of Count Bezúkhov’s death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it.
__label__twp He says the count was the last representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible.
__label__twp God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!  I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child.
__label__twp He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value most in people.
__label__twp As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince Vasíli, it is very sad for both.
__label__twp Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviour’s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true.
__label__twp I pity Prince Vasíli but am still more sorry for Pierre.
__label__twp So young, and burdened with such riches—to what temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar.
__label__twp A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow.
__label__twp Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit.
__label__twp I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity.
__label__twp Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels.
__label__twp Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below.
__label__twp Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.
__label__twp My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasíli.
__label__twp In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform.
__label__twp However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband.
__label__twp I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his wife.
__label__twp This pleasure will be but a brief one, however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why.
__label__twp Not only where you are—at the heart of affairs and of the world—is the talk all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature—which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country—rumors of war are heard and painfully felt.
__label__twp My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene....
__label__twp It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army.
__label__twp You should have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs.
__label__twp It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of injuries—and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another.
__label__twp Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!  MARY  “Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched mine.
__label__twp I have written to my poor mother,” said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r’s.
__label__twp She brought into Princess Mary’s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.
__label__twp “Princess, I must warn you,” she added, lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement, “the prince has been scolding Michael Ivánovich.
__label__twp He is in a very bad humor, very morose.
__label__twp Be prepared.”  “Ah, dear friend,” replied Princess Mary, “I have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in.
__label__twp I do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so.”  The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting room with a look of alarm.
__label__twp Between twelve and two o’clock, as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord.
__label__twp CHAPTER XXVI  The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince, who was in his large study.
__label__twp From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty times repeated—of a sonata by Dussek.
__label__twp Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch.
__label__twp Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before him.
__label__twp Old Tíkhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.
__label__twp Tíkhon knew that neither the son’s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day.
__label__twp Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tíkhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father’s habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he turned to his wife.
__label__twp “He will get up in twenty minutes.
__label__twp Let us go across to Mary’s room,” he said.
__label__twp The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever.
__label__twp “Why, this is a palace!” she said to her husband, looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.
__label__twp “Let’s come, quick, quick!” And with a glance round, she smiled at Tíkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.
__label__twp “Is that Mary practicing? Let’s go quietly and take her by surprise.”  Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.
__label__twp “You’ve grown older, Tíkhon,” he said in passing to the old man, who kissed his hand.
__label__twp Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.
__label__twp “Ah! what joy for the princess!” exclaimed she: “At last! I must let her know.”  “No, no, please not...
__label__twp You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,” said the little princess, kissing her.
__label__twp “I know you already through my sister-in-law’s friendship for you.
__label__twp She was not expecting us?”  They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata.
__label__twp Prince Andrew stopped and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.
__label__twp The little princess entered the room.
__label__twp The passage broke off in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary’s heavy tread and the sound of kissing.
__label__twp When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other’s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch.
__label__twp Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh.
__label__twp Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false note.
__label__twp The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other’s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew’s surprise both began to cry and kissed again.
__label__twp Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry.
__label__twp Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.
__label__twp “Ah! my dear!...
__label__twp Ah! Mary!...” they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed.
__label__twp “I dreamed last night...”—“You were not expecting us?...” “Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?...” “And you have grown stouter!...”  “I knew the princess at once,” put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
__label__twp “And I had no idea!...” exclaimed Princess Mary.
__label__twp “Ah, Andrew, I did not see you.”  Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever.
__label__twp Princess Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince Andrew’s face.
__label__twp The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes.
__label__twp She told of an accident they had had on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odýntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later.
__label__twp Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness.
__label__twp It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law’s words.
__label__twp In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:  “So you are really going to the war, Andrew?” she said sighing.
__label__twp Lise sighed too.
__label__twp “Yes, and even tomorrow,” replied her brother.
__label__twp “He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had promotion...”  Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.
__label__twp “Is it certain?” she said.
__label__twp The face of the little princess changed.
__label__twp She sighed and said: “Yes, quite certain.
__label__twp Ah! it is very dreadful...”  Her lip descended.
__label__twp She brought her face close to her sister-in-law’s and unexpectedly again began to cry.
__label__twp “She needs rest,” said Prince Andrew with a frown.
__label__twp “Don’t you, Lise? Take her to your room and I’ll go to Father.
__label__twp How is he? Just the same?”  “Yes, just the same.
__label__twp Though I don’t know what your opinion will be,” answered the princess joyfully.
__label__twp “And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the lathe?” asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses.
__label__twp “The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons,” said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.
__label__twp When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father.
__label__twp The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son’s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner.
__label__twp The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his father’s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon.
__label__twp “Ah! here’s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?” said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tíkhon was holding fast to plait, would allow.
__label__twp “You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this he’ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?” And he held out his cheek.
__label__twp The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner.
__label__twp (He used to say that a nap “after dinner was silver—before dinner, golden.”) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows.
__label__twp Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him.
__label__twp He made no reply on his father’s favorite topic—making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.
__label__twp “Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,” said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father’s face with an eager and respectful look.
__label__twp “How is your health?”  “Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy.
__label__twp You know me: I am busy from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.”  “Thank God,” said his son smiling.
__label__twp “God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,” he continued, returning to his hobby; “tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call ‘strategy.’”  Prince Andrew smiled.
__label__twp “Give me time to collect my wits, Father,” said he, with a smile that showed that his father’s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him.
__label__twp “Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!”  “Nonsense, nonsense!” cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand.
__label__twp “The house for your wife is ready.
__label__twp Princess Mary will take her there and show her over, and they’ll talk nineteen to the dozen.
__label__twp That’s their woman’s way! I am glad to have her.
__label__twp Sit down and talk.
__label__twp About Mikhelson’s army I understand—Tolstóy ‘s too...
__label__twp a simultaneous expedition....
__label__twp But what’s the southern army to do? Prussia is neutral...
__label__twp I know that.
__label__twp What about Austria?” said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tíkhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles of clothing.
__label__twp “What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?”  Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began—at first reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on—to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign.
__label__twp He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides.
__label__twp The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly interrupted.
__label__twp Once he stopped it by shouting: “The white one, the white one!”  This meant that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.
__label__twp Another time he interrupted, saying:  “And will she soon be confined?” and shaking his head reproachfully said: “That’s bad! Go on, go on.”  The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his description.
__label__twp The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age: “Malbrook s’en va-t-en guerre.
__label__twp Dieu sait quand reviendra.” *       * “Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he’ll      return.”   His son only smiled.
__label__twp “I don’t say it’s a plan I approve of,” said the son; “I am only telling you what it is.
__label__twp Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than this one.”  “Well, you’ve told me nothing new,” and the old man repeated, meditatively and rapidly:  “Dieu sait quand reviendra.
__label__twp Go to the dining room.”      CHAPTER XXVII  At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a strange caprice of his employer’s was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor.
__label__twp The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivánovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich was “not a whit worse than you or I.” At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivánovich more often than to anyone else.
__label__twp In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen—one behind each chair—stood waiting for the prince to enter.
__label__twp The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter.
__label__twp Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkónski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown—an alleged descendant of Rúrik and ancestor of the Bolkónskis.
__label__twp Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.
__label__twp “How thoroughly like him that is!” he said to Princess Mary, who had come up to him.
__label__twp Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise.
__label__twp She did not understand what he was laughing at.
__label__twp Everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question.
__label__twp “Everyone has his Achilles’ heel,” continued Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!”  Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother’s criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study.
__label__twp The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house.
__label__twp At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room.
__label__twp The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess.
__label__twp She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him.
__label__twp He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck.
__label__twp “I’m glad, glad, to see you,” he said, looking attentively into her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down.
__label__twp “Sit down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ivánovich!”  He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law.
__label__twp A footman moved the chair for her.
__label__twp “Ho, ho!” said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.
__label__twp “You’ve been in a hurry.
__label__twp That’s bad!”  He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and not with his eyes.
__label__twp “You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,” he said.
__label__twp The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words.
__label__twp She was silent and seemed confused.
__label__twp The prince asked her about her father, and she began to smile and talk.
__label__twp He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip.
__label__twp “Countess Apráksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out,” she said, growing more and more lively.
__label__twp As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivánovich.
__label__twp “Well, Michael Ivánovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it.
__label__twp Prince Andrew” (he always spoke thus of his son) “has been telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I never thought much of him.”  Michael Ivánovich did not at all know when “you and I” had said such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince’s favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.
__label__twp “He is a great tactician!” said the prince to his son, pointing to the architect.
__label__twp And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the generals and statesmen of the day.
__label__twp The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Potëmkins or Suvórovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing, pretending to do something real.
__label__twp Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father’s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure.
__label__twp “The past always seems good,” said he, “but did not Suvórov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?”  “Who told you that? Who?” cried the prince.
__label__twp “Suvórov!” And he jerked away his plate, which Tíkhon briskly caught.
__label__twp “Suvórov!...
__label__twp Consider, Prince Andrew.
__label__twp Two...
__label__twp Frederick and Suvórov; Moreau!...
__label__twp Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand; but he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands.
__label__twp It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you’ll find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvórov couldn’t manage them so what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No, my dear boy,” he continued, “you and your generals won’t get on against Buonaparte; you’ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together.
__label__twp The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,” he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service....
__label__twp “Wonderful!...
__label__twp Were the Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and Orlóvs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine.
__label__twp May God help you, but we’ll see what will happen.
__label__twp Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!...”  “I don’t at all say that all the plans are good,” said Prince Andrew, “I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte.
__label__twp You may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!”  “Michael Ivánovich!” cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: “Didn’t I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.”  “To be sure, your excellency,” replied the architect.
__label__twp The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.
__label__twp “Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
__label__twp He has got splendid soldiers.
__label__twp Besides he began by attacking Germans.
__label__twp And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans.
__label__twp Since the world began everybody has beaten the Germans.
__label__twp They beat no one—except one another.
__label__twp He made his reputation fighting them.”  And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics.
__label__twp His son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion.
__label__twp He listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political events.
__label__twp “You think I’m an old man and don’t understand the present state of affairs?” concluded his father.
__label__twp “But it troubles me.
__label__twp I don’t sleep at night.
__label__twp Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?” he concluded.
__label__twp “That would take too long to tell,” answered the son.
__label__twp “Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here’s another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,” he exclaimed in excellent French.
__label__twp “You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!”  “Dieu sait quand reviendra.” hummed the prince out of tune and, with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.
__label__twp The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her father-in-law and now at Princess Mary.
__label__twp When they left the table she took her sister-in-law’s arm and drew her into another room.
__label__twp “What a clever man your father is,” said she; “perhaps that is why I am afraid of him.”  “Oh, he is so kind!” answered Princess Mary.
__label__twp CHAPTER XXVIII  Prince Andrew was to leave next evening.
__label__twp The old prince, not altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner.
__label__twp The little princess was in her sister-in-law’s room.
__label__twp Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.
__label__twp After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed.
__label__twp Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber—a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochákov.
__label__twp All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew’s were in very good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.
__label__twp When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind.
__label__twp At such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future.
__label__twp Prince Andrew’s face looked very thoughtful and tender.
__label__twp With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head.
__label__twp Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?—perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression.
__label__twp It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.
__label__twp “I hear you have given orders to harness,” she cried, panting (she had apparently been running), “and I did so wish to have another talk with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted.
__label__twp You are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,” she added, as if to explain such a question.
__label__twp She smiled as she uttered his pet name, “Andrúsha.” It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrúsha—the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood.
__label__twp “And where is Lise?” he asked, answering her question only by a smile.
__label__twp “She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.
__label__twp Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,” said she, sitting down on the sofa, facing her brother.
__label__twp “She is quite a child: such a dear, merry child.
__label__twp I have grown so fond of her.”  Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.
__label__twp “One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them, Andrew? Don’t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society, and so her position now is not a rosy one.
__label__twp We should enter into everyone’s situation.
__label__twp Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner.
__label__twp * Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her condition! It’s very hard.”       * To understand all is to forgive all.
__label__twp Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand.
__label__twp “You live in the country and don’t think the life terrible,” he replied.
__label__twp “I...
__label__twp that’s different.
__label__twp Why speak of me? I don’t want any other life, and can’t, for I know no other.
__label__twp But think, Andrew: for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life, all alone—for Papa is always busy, and I...
__label__twp well, you know what poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.
__label__twp There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....”  “I don’t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she’s much to be pitied.
__label__twp She has no one, no one.
__label__twp To tell the truth, I don’t need her, and she’s even in my way.
__label__twp You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so.
__label__twp I like being alone....
__label__twp Father likes her very much.
__label__twp She and Michael Ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both.
__label__twp As Sterne says: ‘We don’t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.’ Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father.
__label__twp She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading.
__label__twp She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.”  “To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father’s character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn’t it?” Prince Andrew asked suddenly.
__label__twp Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.
__label__twp “For me? For me?...
__label__twp Trying for me!...” said she.
__label__twp “He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he’s getting very trying,” said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister.
__label__twp “You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,” said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation—“and that’s a great sin.
__label__twp How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him.
__label__twp I only wish you were all as happy as I am.”  Her brother shook his head incredulously.
__label__twp “The only thing that is hard for me...
__label__twp I will tell you the truth, Andrew...
__label__twp is Father’s way of treating religious subjects.
__label__twp I don’t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray.
__label__twp That is the only thing that makes me unhappy.
__label__twp But even in this I can see lately a shade of improvement.
__label__twp His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with.”  “Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder,” said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.
__label__twp “Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.
__label__twp Andrew...” she said timidly after a moment’s silence, “I have a great favor to ask of you.”  “What is it, dear?”  “No—promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me.
__label__twp Promise, Andrúsha!...” said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted.
__label__twp She looked timidly at her brother.
__label__twp “Even if it were a great deal of trouble...” answered Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it was about.
__label__twp “Think what you please! I know you are just like Father.
__label__twp Think as you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father’s father, our grandfather, wore it in all his wars.” (She still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule.) “So you promise?”  “Of course.
__label__twp What is it?”  “Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off.
__label__twp Do you promise?”  “If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won’t break my neck...
__label__twp To please you...” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp But immediately, noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister’s face, he repented and added: “I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.”  “Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,” said she in a voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.
__label__twp She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.
__label__twp “Please, Andrew, for my sake!...”  Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes.
__label__twp Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful.
__label__twp Her brother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him.
__label__twp Andrew understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon.
__label__twp There was a look of tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.
__label__twp “Thank you, my dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa.
__label__twp They were silent for a while.
__label__twp “As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always used to be.
__label__twp Don’t judge Lise harshly,” she began.
__label__twp “She is so sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.”  “I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or blamed her.
__label__twp Why do you say all this to me?”  Red patches appeared on Princess Mary’s face and she was silent as if she felt guilty.
__label__twp “I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to.
__label__twp And I am sorry for that,” he went on.
__label__twp The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks.
__label__twp She tried to say something but could not.
__label__twp Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her fate, her father-in-law, and her husband.
__label__twp After crying she had fallen asleep.
__label__twp Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.
__label__twp “Know this, Másha: I can’t reproach, have not reproached, and never shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever circumstances I may be placed.
__label__twp But if you want to know the truth...
__label__twp if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is so I don’t know...”  As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her forehead.
__label__twp His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.
__label__twp “Let us go to her, I must say good-by.
__label__twp Or—go and wake and I’ll come in a moment.
__label__twp Petrúshka!” he called to his valet: “Come here, take these away.
__label__twp Put this on the seat and this to the right.”  Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said: “Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been answered.”  “Well, maybe!” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Go, Másha; I’ll come immediately.”  On the way to his sister’s room, in the passage which connected one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly.
__label__twp It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.
__label__twp “Oh! I thought you were in your room,” she said, for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes.
__label__twp Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face.
__label__twp He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word.
__label__twp When he reached his sister’s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying one word after another, came through the open door.
__label__twp She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make up for lost time.
__label__twp “No, but imagine the old Countess Zúbova, with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age....
__label__twp Ha, ha, ha! Mary!”  This very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times.
__label__twp He entered the room softly.
__label__twp The little princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases.
__label__twp Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey.
__label__twp She answered him and continued her chatter.
__label__twp The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch.
__label__twp It was an autumn night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.
__label__twp Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch.
__label__twp The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows.
__label__twp The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to the young prince.
__label__twp The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael Ivánovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess.
__label__twp Prince Andrew had been called to his father’s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone.
__label__twp All were waiting for them to come out.
__label__twp When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his son, sat at the table writing.
__label__twp He glanced round.
__label__twp “Going?” And he went on writing.
__label__twp “I’ve come to say good-by.”  “Kiss me here,” and he touched his cheek: “Thanks, thanks!”  “What do you thank me for?”  “For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman’s apron strings.
__label__twp The Service before everything.
__label__twp Thanks, thanks!” And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked.
__label__twp “If you have anything to say, say it.
__label__twp These two things can be done together,” he added.
__label__twp “About my wife...
__label__twp I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands....”  “Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.”  “When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur....
__label__twp Let him be here....”  The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his son.
__label__twp “I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,” said Prince Andrew, evidently confused.
__label__twp “I know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine.
__label__twp They have been telling her things.
__label__twp She has had a dream and is frightened.”  “Hm...
__label__twp Hm...” muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was writing.
__label__twp “I’ll do it.”  He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh.
__label__twp “It’s a bad business, eh?”  “What is bad, Father?”  “The wife!” said the old prince, briefly and significantly.
__label__twp “I don’t understand!” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “No, it can’t be helped, lad,” said the prince.
__label__twp “They’re all like that; one can’t unmarry.
__label__twp Don’t be afraid; I won’t tell anyone, but you know it yourself.”  He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his son’s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.
__label__twp The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him.
__label__twp The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.
__label__twp “What’s to be done? She’s pretty! I will do everything.
__label__twp Make your mind easy,” said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.
__label__twp Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him.
__label__twp The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.
__label__twp “Listen!” said he; “don’t worry about your wife: what can be done shall be.
__label__twp Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich.
__label__twp * I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him.
__label__twp Write and tell me how he receives you.
__label__twp If he is all right—serve him.
__label__twp Nicholas Bolkónski’s son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor.
__label__twp Now come here.”       *Kutúzov.
__label__twp He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son was accustomed to understand him.
__label__twp He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his bold, tall, close handwriting.
__label__twp “I shall probably die before you.
__label__twp So remember, these are my memoirs; hand them to the Emperor after my death.
__label__twp Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvórov’s wars.
__label__twp Send it to the Academy.
__label__twp Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone.
__label__twp You will find them useful.”  Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet.
__label__twp He felt that he must not say it.
__label__twp “I will do it all, Father,” he said.
__label__twp “Well, now, good-by!” He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him.
__label__twp “Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old father...” he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: “but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkónski, I shall be ashamed!”  “You need not have said that to me, Father,” said the son with a smile.
__label__twp The old man was silent.
__label__twp “I also wanted to ask you,” continued Prince Andrew, “if I’m killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you—as I said yesterday...
__label__twp let him grow up with you....
__label__twp Please.”  “Not let the wife have him?” said the old man, and laughed.
__label__twp They stood silent, facing one another.
__label__twp The old man’s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son’s.
__label__twp Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince’s face.
__label__twp “We’ve said good-by.
__label__twp Go!” he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice, opening his door.
__label__twp “What is it? What?” asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.
__label__twp Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.
__label__twp “Well!” he said, turning to his wife.
__label__twp And this “Well!” sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: “Now go through your performance.”  “Andrew, already!” said the little princess, turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband.
__label__twp He embraced her.
__label__twp She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.
__label__twp He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.
__label__twp “Adieu, Mary,” said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.
__label__twp The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing her temples.
__label__twp Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction.
__label__twp From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose.
__label__twp Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out.
__label__twp “Gone? That’s all right!” said he; and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door.
__label__twp BOOK TWO: 1805      CHAPTER I  In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered.
__label__twp Braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov.
__label__twp On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief.
__label__twp Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality and surroundings—fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distance—and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.
__label__twp On the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march.
__label__twp Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to “bow too low than not bow low enough.” So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before—presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness.
__label__twp And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, “awl, soap, and all,” as the soldiers say.
__label__twp There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease.
__label__twp It was the state of the soldiers’ boots.
__label__twp More than half the men’s boots were in holes.
__label__twp But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.
__label__twp The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders.
__label__twp He had on a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders.
__label__twp He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life.
__label__twp He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back.
__label__twp It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.
__label__twp “Well, Michael Mítrich, sir?” he said, addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both felt happy).
__label__twp “We had our hands full last night.
__label__twp However, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?”  The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.
__label__twp “It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsarítsin Meadow.”  “What?” asked the commander.
__label__twp At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted, two men appeared on horse back.
__label__twp They were an aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack.
__label__twp The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation whatever.
__label__twp A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutúzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutúzov, not considering this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from Russia.
__label__twp With this object he intended to meet the regiment; so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander in chief would be.
__label__twp Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied.
__label__twp On hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.
__label__twp “A fine mess we’ve made of it!” he remarked.
__label__twp “There now! Didn’t I tell you, Michael Mítrich, that if it was said ‘on the march’ it meant in greatcoats?” said he reproachfully to the battalion commander.
__label__twp “Oh, my God!” he added, stepping resolutely forward.
__label__twp “Company commanders!” he shouted in a voice accustomed to command.
__label__twp “Sergeants major!...
__label__twp How soon will he be here?” he asked the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to.
__label__twp “In an hour’s time, I should say.”  “Shall we have time to change clothes?”  “I don’t know, General....”  The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats.
__label__twp The company commanders ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices.
__label__twp On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.
__label__twp In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray instead of black.
__label__twp The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.
__label__twp “Whatever is this? This!” he shouted and stood still.
__label__twp “Commander of the third company!”  “Commander of the third company wanted by the general!...
__label__twp commander to the general...
__label__twp third company to the commander.” The words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.
__label__twp When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of: “The general to the third company,” the missing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general.
__label__twp The captain’s face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned.
__label__twp Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously.
__label__twp The general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.
__label__twp “You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?” shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others.
__label__twp “What have you been after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I’ll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade....
__label__twp Eh...?”  The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior, pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation.
__label__twp “Well, why don’t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a Hungarian?” said the commander with an austere gibe.
__label__twp “Your excellency...”  “Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your excellency?...
__label__twp nobody knows.”  “Your excellency, it’s the officer Dólokhov, who has been reduced to the ranks,” said the captain softly.
__label__twp “Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others.”  “Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.”  “Gave him leave? Leave? That’s just like you young men,” said the regimental commander cooling down a little.
__label__twp “Leave indeed....
__label__twp One says a word to you and you...
__label__twp What?” he added with renewed irritation, “I beg you to dress your men decently.”  And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky steps down the line.
__label__twp He was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath.
__label__twp Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.
__label__twp “H-o-o-w are you standing? Where’s your leg? Your leg?” shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were still five men between him and Dólokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.
__label__twp Dólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his clear, insolent eyes in the general’s face.
__label__twp “Why a blue coat? Off with it...
__label__twp Sergeant major! Change his coat...
__label__twp the ras...” he did not finish.
__label__twp “General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...” Dólokhov hurriedly interrupted.
__label__twp “No talking in the ranks!...
__label__twp No talking, no talking!”  “Not bound to endure insults,” Dólokhov concluded in loud, ringing tones.
__label__twp The eyes of the general and the soldier met.
__label__twp The general became silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.
__label__twp “I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,” he said as he turned away.
__label__twp CHAPTER II  “He’s coming!” shouted the signaler at that moment.
__label__twp The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself, drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to shout.
__label__twp The regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless.
__label__twp “Att-ention!” shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and welcome for the approaching chief.
__label__twp Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high, light blue Viennese calèche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot.
__label__twp Behind the calèche galloped the suite and a convoy of Croats.
__label__twp Beside Kutúzov sat an Austrian general, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones.
__label__twp The calèche stopped in front of the regiment.
__label__twp Kutúzov and the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kutúzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist.
__label__twp The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a jingling sound it presented arms.
__label__twp Then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard.
__label__twp The regiment roared, “Health to your ex...
__label__twp len...
__label__twp len...
__label__twp lency!” and again all became silent.
__label__twp At first Kutúzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.
__label__twp From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander.
__label__twp Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition.
__label__twp There were only 217 sick and stragglers.
__label__twp Everything was in good order except the boots.
__label__twp Kutúzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes also to the soldiers.
__label__twp Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was.
__label__twp The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief’s regarding the regiment.
__label__twp Behind Kutúzov, at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite.
__label__twp These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed.
__label__twp Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant.
__label__twp This was Prince Bolkónski.
__label__twp Beside him was his comrade Nesvítski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes.
__label__twp Nesvítski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him.
__label__twp This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental commander’s back and mimicked his every movement.
__label__twp Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner.
__label__twp Nesvítski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag.
__label__twp Kutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief.
__label__twp On reaching the third company he suddenly stopped.
__label__twp His suite, not having expected this, involuntarily came closer to him.
__label__twp “Ah, Timókhin!” said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.
__label__twp One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutúzov, who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face.
__label__twp “Another Ismail comrade,” said he.
__label__twp “A brave officer! Are you satisfied with him?” he asked the regimental commander.
__label__twp And the latter—unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass—started, moved forward, and answered: “Highly satisfied, your excellency!”  “We all have our weaknesses,” said Kutúzov smiling and walking away from him.
__label__twp “He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.”  The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer.
__label__twp The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that Nesvítski could not help laughing.
__label__twp Kutúzov turned round.
__label__twp The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and while Kutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.
__label__twp The third company was the last, and Kutúzov pondered, apparently trying to recollect something.
__label__twp Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in French:  “You told me to remind you of the officer Dólokhov, reduced to the ranks in this regiment.”  “Where is Dólokhov?” asked Kutúzov.
__label__twp Dólokhov, who had already changed into a soldier’s gray greatcoat, did not wait to be called.
__label__twp The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.
__label__twp “Have you a complaint to make?” Kutúzov asked with a slight frown.
__label__twp “This is Dólokhov,” said Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Ah!” said Kutúzov.
__label__twp “I hope this will be a lesson to you.
__label__twp Do your duty.
__label__twp The Emperor is gracious, and I shan’t forget you if you deserve well.”  The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private.
__label__twp “One thing I ask of your excellency,” Dólokhov said in his firm, ringing, deliberate voice.
__label__twp “I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!”  Kutúzov turned away.
__label__twp The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from Captain Timókhin again flitted over his face.
__label__twp He turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dólokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted.
__label__twp He turned away and went to the carriage.
__label__twp The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches.
__label__twp “You won’t bear me a grudge, Prokhór Ignátych?” said the regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in front.
__label__twp (The regimental commander’s face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight.) “It’s in the Emperor’s service...
__label__twp it can’t be helped...
__label__twp one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade...
__label__twp I am the first to apologize, you know me!...
__label__twp He was very pleased!” And he held out his hand to the captain.
__label__twp “Don’t mention it, General, as if I’d be so bold!” replied the captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail.
__label__twp “And tell Mr.
__label__twp Dólokhov that I won’t forget him—he may be quite easy.
__label__twp And tell me, please—I’ve been meaning to ask—how is he behaving himself, and in general...”  “As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency; but his character...” said Timókhin.
__label__twp “And what about his character?” asked the regimental commander.
__label__twp “It’s different on different days,” answered the captain.
__label__twp “One day he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he’s a wild beast....
__label__twp In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.”  “Oh, well, well!” remarked the regimental commander.
__label__twp “Still, one must have pity on a young man in misfortune.
__label__twp You know he has important connections...
__label__twp Well, then, you just...”  “I will, your excellency,” said Timókhin, showing by his smile that he understood his commander’s wish.
__label__twp “Well, of course, of course!”  The regimental commander sought out Dólokhov in the ranks and, reining in his horse, said to him:  “After the next affair...
__label__twp epaulettes.”  Dólokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking smile on his lips change.
__label__twp “Well, that’s all right,” continued the regimental commander.
__label__twp “A cup of vodka for the men from me,” he added so that the soldiers could hear.
__label__twp “I thank you all! God be praised!” and he rode past that company and overtook the next one.
__label__twp “Well, he’s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,” said Timókhin to the subaltern beside him.
__label__twp “In a word, a hearty one...” said the subaltern, laughing (the regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).
__label__twp The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers.
__label__twp The company marched on gaily.
__label__twp The soldiers’ voices could be heard on every side.
__label__twp “And they said Kutúzov was blind of one eye?”  “And so he is! Quite blind!”  “No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are.
__label__twp Boots and leg bands...
__label__twp he noticed everything...”  “When he looked at my feet, friend...
__label__twp well, thinks I...”  “And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were smeared with chalk—as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as they do the guns.”  “I say, Fédeshon!...
__label__twp Did he say when the battles are to begin? You were near him.
__label__twp Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.”  “Buonaparte himself!...
__label__twp Just listen to the fool, what he doesn’t know! The Prussians are up in arms now.
__label__twp The Austrians, you see, are putting them down.
__label__twp When they’ve been put down, the war with Buonaparte will begin.
__label__twp And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you’re a fool.
__label__twp You’d better listen more carefully!”  “What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is turning into the village already...
__label__twp they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters.”  “Give me a biscuit, you devil!”  “And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That’s just it, friend! Ah, well, never mind, here you are.”  “They might call a halt here or we’ll have to do another four miles without eating.”  “Wasn’t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still and are drawn along.”  “And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly.
__label__twp There they all seemed to be Poles—all under the Russian crown—but here they’re all regular Germans.”  “Singers to the front” came the captain’s order.
__label__twp And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front.
__label__twp A drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers’ song, commencing with the words: “Morning dawned, the sun was rising,” and concluding: “On then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father Kámenski.” This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that the words “Father Kámenski” were replaced by “Father Kutúzov.”  Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer—a lean, handsome soldier of forty—looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes.
__label__twp Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and began:  “Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!”  “Oh, my bower new...!” chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone.
__label__twp The soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long steps.
__label__twp Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses’ hoofs were heard.
__label__twp Kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town.
__label__twp The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men.
__label__twp In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice.
__label__twp It was Dólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company.
__label__twp The hussar cornet of Kutúzov’s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the carriage and rode up to Dólokhov.
__label__twp Hussar cornet Zherkóv had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the wild set led by Dólokhov.
__label__twp Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him.
__label__twp But now that Kutúzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend.
__label__twp “My dear fellow, how are you?” said he through the singing, making his horse keep pace with the company.
__label__twp “How am I?” Dólokhov answered coldly.
__label__twp “I am as you see.”  The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkóv spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dólokhov’s reply.
__label__twp “And how do you get on with the officers?” inquired Zherkóv.
__label__twp “All right.
__label__twp They are good fellows.
__label__twp And how have you wriggled onto the staff?”  “I was attached; I’m on duty.”  Both were silent.
__label__twp “She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,” went the song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.
__label__twp Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song.
__label__twp “Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?” asked Dólokhov.
__label__twp “The devil only knows! They say so.”  “I’m glad,” answered Dólokhov briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.
__label__twp “I say, come round some evening and we’ll have a game of faro!” said Zherkóv.
__label__twp “Why, have you too much money?”  “Do come.”  “I can’t.
__label__twp I’ve sworn not to.
__label__twp I won’t drink and won’t play till I get reinstated.”  “Well, that’s only till the first engagement.”  “We shall see.”  They were again silent.
__label__twp “Come if you need anything.
__label__twp One can at least be of use on the staff...”  Dólokhov smiled.
__label__twp “Don’t trouble.
__label__twp If I want anything, I won’t beg—I’ll take it!”  “Well, never mind; I only...”  “And I only...”  “Good-by.”  “Good health...”          “It’s a long, long way.
__label__twp To my native land...”   Zherkóv touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the song.
__label__twp CHAPTER III  On returning from the review, Kutúzov took the Austrian general into his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of the advanced army.
__label__twp Prince Andrew Bolkónski came into the room with the required papers.
__label__twp Kutúzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.
__label__twp “Ah!...” said Kutúzov glancing at Bolkónski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in French.
__label__twp “All I can say, General,” said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word.
__label__twp It was evident that Kutúzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice.
__label__twp “All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago.
__label__twp I should long ago have joined the archduke.
__label__twp And believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general—of whom Austria has so many—and to lay down all this heavy responsibility.
__label__twp But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General.”  And Kutúzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, “You are quite at liberty not to believe me and I don’t even care whether you do or not, but you have no grounds for telling me so.
__label__twp And that is the whole point.”  The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone.
__label__twp “On the contrary,” he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, “on the contrary, your excellency’s participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,” he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence.
__label__twp Kutúzov bowed with the same smile.
__label__twp “But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,” said Kutúzov.
__label__twp The general frowned.
__label__twp Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutúzov’s suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony.
__label__twp But Kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so.
__label__twp And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack’s army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable.
__label__twp “Give me that letter,” said Kutúzov turning to Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Please have a look at it”—and Kutúzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand’s letter:  We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech.
__label__twp Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally.
__label__twp We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.
__label__twp Kutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.
__label__twp “But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect the worst,” said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business.
__label__twp He involuntarily looked round at the aide-de-camp.
__label__twp “Excuse me, General,” interrupted Kutúzov, also turning to Prince Andrew.
__label__twp “Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.” 
__label__twp It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite. 
__label__twp All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows: 
__label__twp “If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Schérer.” 
__label__twp “Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa. 
__label__twp “First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned. 
__label__twp “Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are staying the whole evening, I hope?” 
__label__twp “And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming for me to take me there.” 
__label__twp “I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.” 
__label__twp “If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed. 
__label__twp “Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.” 
__label__twp “What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.” 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct. 
__label__twp In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst out: 
__label__twp “Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander’s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!” 
__label__twp She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity. 
__label__twp “I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?” 
__label__twp “In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?” 
__label__twp “I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.” 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the baron. 
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with. 
__label__twp “Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone. 
__label__twp As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness. 
__label__twp The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said: 
__label__twp “Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.” 
__label__twp The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude. 
__label__twp “I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t like him,” she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. “Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.” 
__label__twp And she smiled her ecstatic smile. 
__label__twp “I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.” 
__label__twp “Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and you were pitied....” 
__label__twp The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned. 
__label__twp “What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant. 
__label__twp “And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna Pávlovna, looking up pensively. 
__label__twp “I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can’t be helped!” 
__label__twp He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated. 
__label__twp “Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she asked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.” 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information. 
__label__twp “Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?” Presently he added: “That’s what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?” 
__label__twp “Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov’s and will be here tonight.” 
__label__twp “Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna’s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and that’s all I want.” 
__label__twp And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction. 
__label__twp “Attendez,” said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to Lise, young Bolkónski’s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.” 
__label__twp CHAPTER II 
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasíli’s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her father to the ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya, known as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasíli’s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio and many others had also come. 
__label__twp      * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg. 
__label__twp To each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my aunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then left them. 
__label__twp Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, “who, thank God, was better today.” And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening. 
__label__twp The young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day. 
__label__twp The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. “I have brought my work,” said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. “Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,” she added, turning to her hostess. “You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.” And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast. 
__label__twp “Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,” replied Anna Pávlovna. 
__label__twp “You know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she added, addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène. 
__label__twp “What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna. 
__label__twp One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known grandee of Catherine’s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room. 
__label__twp “It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her. 
__label__twp Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance. 
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’s health. Anna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “Do you know the Abbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.” 
__label__twp “Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.” 
__label__twp “You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s plan chimerical. 
__label__twp “We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile. 
__label__twp And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé. 
__label__twp Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing. 
__label__twp CHAPTER III 
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince Vasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna. 
__label__twp The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d’Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte’s hatred of him. 
__label__twp “Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence: “Contez nous çela, Vicomte.” 
__label__twp The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to listen to his tale. 
__label__twp “The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to one of the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she to another. “How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish. 
__label__twp The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile. 
__label__twp “Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group. 
__label__twp The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect. 
__label__twp “How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile. 
__label__twp “Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he, smilingly inclining his head. 
__label__twp The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile. 
__label__twp The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène. 
__label__twp “Wait a moment, I’ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?” she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me my workbag.” 
__label__twp There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat. 
__label__twp “Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took up her work. 
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her. 
__label__twp Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions. 
__label__twp “It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak. 
__label__twp “Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders. 
__label__twp “Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them. 
__label__twp He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings. 
__label__twp The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death. 
__label__twp The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated. 
__label__twp “Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess. 
__label__twp “Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it. 
__label__twp The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved. 
__label__twp “The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,” the abbé was saying. “It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!” 
__label__twp “But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning. 
__label__twp At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women. 
__label__twp “I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,” said he. 
__label__twp Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger circle. 
__label__twp CHAPTER IV 
__label__twp Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew Bolkónski, the little princess’ husband. He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company. 
__label__twp “You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna. 
__label__twp “General Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general’s name like a Frenchman, “has been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....” 
__label__twp “And Lise, your wife?” 
__label__twp “She will go to the country.” 
__label__twp “Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?” 
__label__twp “André,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile. 
__label__twp “There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to Pierre. 
__label__twp “I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper with you. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story. 
__label__twp “No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre’s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass. 
__label__twp “You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna. 
__label__twp His daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him. 
__label__twp “Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew. 
__label__twp “Very,” said Pierre. 
__label__twp In passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna: “Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.” 
__label__twp  Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s. The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear. 
__label__twp “How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy.” 
__label__twp Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away. 
__label__twp “What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?” said she. 
__label__twp “Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered Prince Vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would be the best way.” 
__label__twp The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte’s story. Prince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli’s arm more tightly. 
__label__twp “Listen to me, Prince,” said she. “I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father’s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’s sake to do this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,” she added hurriedly. “No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have asked Golítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,” she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes. 
__label__twp “Papa, we shall be late,” said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door. 
__label__twp Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess Drubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved him. 
__label__twp “My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s memory, I will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?” 
__label__twp “My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew your kindness!” He turned to go. 
__label__twp “Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...” she faltered. “You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...” 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli smiled. 
__label__twp “No, I won’t promise that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.” 
__label__twp “No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My dear benefactor...” 
__label__twp “Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, “we shall be late.” 
__label__twp “Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?” 
__label__twp “Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?” 
__label__twp “Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promise.” 
__label__twp “Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face. 
__label__twp Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accomplished. 
__label__twp CHAPTER V 
__label__twp “And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?” asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile. 
__label__twp “‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’ * They say he was very fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’ 
__label__twp      * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware! 
__label__twp “I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over,” Anna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.” 
__label__twp “The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: “The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became more animated. “And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.” 
__label__twp And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position. 
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it. 
__label__twp “Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,” said he. 
__label__twp The princess listened, smiling. 
__label__twp “If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—I mean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, and then....” 
__label__twp He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted: 
__label__twp “The Emperor Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant. 
__label__twp “That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew. “Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime.” 
__label__twp “From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte’s side.” 
__label__twp “It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre. “At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion.” 
__label__twp “Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile. 
__label__twp It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him, though without looking at him. 
__label__twp “‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,’” Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon’s words. “‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.’ I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.” 
__label__twp “Not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some people,” he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth.” 
__label__twp Before Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him. 
__label__twp “The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre, “was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed.” 
__label__twp “Dieu! Mon Dieu!” muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper. 
__label__twp “What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work nearer to her. 
__label__twp “Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices. 
__label__twp “Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand. 
__label__twp The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued. 
__label__twp “I say so,” he continued desperately, “because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man’s life.” 
__label__twp “Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna Pávlovna. 
__label__twp But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her. 
__label__twp “No,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain power.” 
__label__twp “Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him a great man,” remarked the vicomte. 
__label__twp “He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind. 
__label__twp “What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But won’t you come to this other table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna. 
__label__twp “Rousseau’s Contrat Social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant smile. 
__label__twp “I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.” 
__label__twp “Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an ironical voice. 
__label__twp “Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force.” 
__label__twp “Liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of Pierre’s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator. 
__label__twp “But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is innocent and untried?” 
__label__twp “I should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!” 
__label__twp “And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders. 
__label__twp “He’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince Hippolyte. 
__label__twp Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another—a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness. 
__label__twp The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent. 
__label__twp “How do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said Prince Andrew. “Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it seems to me.” 
__label__twp “Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement. 
__label__twp “One must admit,” continued Prince Andrew, “that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go. 
__label__twp Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend, and asking them all to be seated began: 
__label__twp “I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it. Excuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost....” And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story. 
__label__twp “There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her taste. And she had a lady’s maid, also big. She said....” 
__label__twp Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty. 
__label__twp “She said.... Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.’” 
__label__twp Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did however smile. 
__label__twp “She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down....” Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole world knew....” 
__label__twp And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where. 
__label__twp CHAPTER VI 
__label__twp Having thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their leave. 
__label__twp Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general’s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna Pávlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: “I hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.” 
__label__twp When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “Opinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.” And everyone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt this. 
__label__twp Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to his wife’s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass. 
__label__twp “Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess, taking leave of Anna Pávlovna. “It is settled,” she added in a low voice. 
__label__twp Anna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess’ sister-in-law. 
__label__twp “I rely on you, my dear,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone. “Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au revoir! ”—and she left the hall. 
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face close to her, began to whisper something. 
__label__twp Two footmen, the princess’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh. 
__label__twp “I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador’s,” said Prince Hippolyte “—so dull—. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!” 
__label__twp “They say the ball will be very good,” replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip. “All the pretty women in society will be there.” 
__label__twp “Not all, for you will not be there; not all,” said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her. 
__label__twp Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her husband. Prince Andrew’s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he seem. 
__label__twp “Are you ready?” he asked his wife, looking past her. 
__label__twp Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage. 
__label__twp “Princesse, au revoir,” cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet. 
__label__twp The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone’s way. 
__label__twp “Allow me, sir,” said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path. 
__label__twp “I am expecting you, Pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and affectionately. 
__label__twp The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home. 
__label__twp “Well, mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very nice indeed, quite French,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laughing. 
__label__twp “Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,” continued the vicomte. “I pity the poor husband, that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch.” 
__label__twp Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, “And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to know how to deal with them.” 
__label__twp Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew’s study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar’s Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle. 
__label__twp “What have you done to Mlle Schérer? She will be quite ill now,” said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands. 
__label__twp Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand. 
__label__twp “That abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but—I do not know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....” 
__label__twp It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation. 
__label__twp “One can’t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?” asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence. 
__label__twp Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him. 
__label__twp “Really, I don’t yet know. I don’t like either the one or the other.” 
__label__twp “But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.” 
__label__twp Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man, “Now go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.” Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead. 
__label__twp “But he must be a Freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom he had met that evening. 
__label__twp “That is all nonsense.” Prince Andrew again interrupted him, “let us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?” 
__label__twp “No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’s childish words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question. 
__label__twp “If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,” he said. 
__label__twp “And that would be splendid,” said Pierre. 
__label__twp Prince Andrew smiled ironically. 
__label__twp “Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....” 
__label__twp “Well, why are you going to the war?” asked Pierre. 
__label__twp “What for? I don’t know. I must. Besides that I am going....” He paused. “I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!” 
__label__twp CHAPTER VII 
__label__twp The rustle of a woman’s dress was heard in the next room. Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her. 
__label__twp “How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, “how is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!” 
__label__twp “And I am still arguing with your husband. I can’t understand why he wants to go to the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women. 
__label__twp The princess started. Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the quick. 
__label__twp “Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she. “I don’t understand it; I don’t in the least understand why men can’t live without wars. How is it that we women don’t want anything of the kind, don’t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle’s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the Apráksins’ I heard a lady asking, ‘Is that the famous Prince Andrew?’ I did indeed.” She laughed. “He is so well received everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?” 
__label__twp Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the conversation, gave no reply. 
__label__twp “When are you starting?” he asked. 
__label__twp “Oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t! I won’t hear it spoken of,” said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. “Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ... and then you know, André...” (she looked significantly at her husband) “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back. 
__label__twp Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness. 
__label__twp “What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’t understand,” said he. 
__label__twp “There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country.” 
__label__twp “With my father and sister, remember,” said Prince Andrew gently. 
__label__twp “Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be afraid.” 
__label__twp Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that. 
__label__twp “I still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife. 
__label__twp The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair. 
__label__twp “No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....” 
__label__twp “Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew. “You had better go.” 
__label__twp The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room. 
__label__twp Pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind. 
__label__twp “Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. “I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?” 
__label__twp “Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly: 
__label__twp “You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave like that six months ago?” 
__label__twp “Lise, I beg you to desist,” said Prince Andrew still more emphatically. 
__label__twp Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself. 
__label__twp “Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here.... No, don’t distress yourself.... Good-by!” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew caught him by the hand. 
__label__twp “No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.” 
__label__twp “No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears. 
__label__twp “Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted. 
__label__twp Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail. 
__label__twp “Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!” she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead. 
__label__twp “Good night, Lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger. 
__label__twp CHAPTER VIII 
__label__twp The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand. 
__label__twp “Let us go and have supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door. 
__label__twp They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out. 
__label__twp “Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That’s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what’s the good?...” and he waved his arm. 
__label__twp Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement. 
__label__twp “My wife,” continued Prince Andrew, “is an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a man’s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.” 
__label__twp As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkónski who had lolled in Anna Pávlovna’s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation. 
__label__twp “You don’t understand why I say this,” he continued, “but it is the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,” said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), “but Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,” continued Prince Andrew, “and at Anna Pávlovna’s they listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything—that’s what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there’s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don’t marry, my dear fellow; don’t marry!” concluded Prince Andrew. 
__label__twp “It seems funny to me,” said Pierre, “that you, you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything before you, everything. And you....” 
__label__twp He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future. 
__label__twp “How can he talk like that?” thought Pierre. He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew’s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew’s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength. 
__label__twp Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly. 
__label__twp “My part is played out,” said Prince Andrew. “What’s the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you,” he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts. 
__label__twp That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’s face. 
__label__twp “But what is there to say about me?” said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. “What am I? An illegitimate son!” He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. “Without a name and without means... And it really...” But he did not say what “it really” was. “For the present I am free and am all right. Only I haven’t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance—friendly and affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority. 
__label__twp “I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our whole set. Yes, you’re all right! Choose what you will; it’s all the same. You’ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those Kurágins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly—all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!” 
__label__twp “What would you have, my dear fellow?” answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. “Women, my dear fellow; women!” 
__label__twp “I don’t understand it,” replied Prince Andrew. “Women who are comme il faut, that’s a different matter; but the Kurágins’ set of women, ‘women and wine’ I don’t understand!” 
__label__twp Pierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew’s sister. 
__label__twp “Do you know?” said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, “seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I can’t decide or think properly about anything. One’s head aches, and one spends all one’s money. He asked me for tonight, but I won’t go.” 
__label__twp “You give me your word of honor not to go?” 
__label__twp “On my honor!” 
__label__twp CHAPTER IX 
__label__twp It was past one o’clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of. 
__label__twp “I should like to go to Kurágin’s,” thought he. 
__label__twp But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; “besides,” thought he, “all such ‘words of honor’ are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!” Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kurágin’s. 
__label__twp Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards’ barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance. 
__label__twp Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others. 
__label__twp “I bet a hundred on Stevens!” shouted one. 
__label__twp “Mind, no holding on!” cried another. 
__label__twp “I bet on Dólokhov!” cried a third. “Kurágin, you part our hands.” 
__label__twp “There, leave Bruin alone; here’s a bet on.” 
__label__twp “At one draught, or he loses!” shouted a fourth. 
__label__twp “Jacob, bring a bottle!” shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front. “Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is Pétya! Good man!” cried he, addressing Pierre. 
__label__twp Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: “Come here; part the bets!” This was Dólokhov, an officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily. 
__label__twp “I don’t understand. What’s it all about?” 
__label__twp “Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,” said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre. 
__label__twp “First of all you must drink!” 
__label__twp Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre’s glass while explaining that Dólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out. 
__label__twp “Go on, you must drink it all,” said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, “or I won’t let you go!” 
__label__twp “No, I won’t,” said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window. 
__label__twp Dólokhov was holding the Englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre. 
__label__twp Dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face. Dólokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg. 
__label__twp The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around. 
__label__twp Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not move it. He smashed a pane. 
__label__twp “You have a try, Hercules,” said he, turning to Pierre. 
__label__twp Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash. 
__label__twp “Take it right out, or they’ll think I’m holding on,” said Dólokhov. 
__label__twp “Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?” said Anatole. 
__label__twp “First-rate,” said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible. 
__label__twp Dólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill. “Listen!” cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room. All were silent. 
__label__twp “I bet fifty imperials”—he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did not speak it very well—“I bet fifty imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?” added he, addressing the Englishman. 
__label__twp “No, fifty,” replied the latter. 
__label__twp “All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot” (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) “and without holding on to anything. Is that right?” 
__label__twp “Quite right,” said the Englishman. 
__label__twp Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was short—began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English. 
__label__twp “Wait!” cried Dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. “Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?” 
__label__twp The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating Dólokhov’s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and looked down. 
__label__twp “Oh! Oh! Oh!” he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement. 
__label__twp “Shut up!” cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs. 
__label__twp Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. Dólokhov’s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dólokhov’s shirt. 
__label__twp “I say, this is folly! He’ll be killed,” said this more sensible man. 
__label__twp Anatole stopped him. 
__label__twp “Don’t touch him! You’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed. Eh?... What then?... Eh?” 
__label__twp Dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his seat. 
__label__twp “If anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, “I will throw him down there. Now then!” 
__label__twp Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from Dólokhov’s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back. “Why is it so long?” thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dólokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face. 
__label__twp “It’s empty.” 
__label__twp He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. Dólokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum. 
__label__twp “Well done!... Fine fellow!... There’s a bet for you!... Devil take you!” came from different sides. 
__label__twp The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money. Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window sill. 
__label__twp “Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I’ll do the same thing!” he suddenly cried. “Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a bottle. I’ll do it.... Bring a bottle!” 
__label__twp “Let him do it, let him do it,” said Dólokhov, smiling. 
__label__twp “What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,” exclaimed several voices. 
__label__twp “I’ll drink it! Let’s have a bottle of rum!” shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window. 
__label__twp They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying. 
__label__twp “No, you’ll never manage him that way,” said Anatole. “Wait a bit and I’ll get round him.... Listen! I’ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to ——’s.” 
__label__twp “Come on then,” cried Pierre. “Come on!... And we’ll take Bruin with us.” 
__label__twp And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it. 
__label__twp CHAPTER X 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskáya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Borís on the evening of Anna Pávlovna’s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Borís transferred into the regiment of Semënov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to Kutúzov’s staff despite all Anna Mikháylovna’s endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivílov. 
__label__twp It was St. Natalia’s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—the mother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly. Ever since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva’s big house on the Povarskáya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays. 
__label__twp The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner. 
__label__twp “I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,” or “ma chère”—he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, “my dear,” whether they were above or below him in rank—“I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma chère! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!” These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dmítri Vasílevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: “Well, Dmítri, you’ll see that things are all as they should be? That’s right! The great thing is the serving, that’s it.” And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room. 
__label__twp “Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!” announced the countess’ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband’s portrait on it. 
__label__twp “I’m quite worn out by these callers. However, I’ll see her and no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,” she said to the footman in a sad voice, as if saying: “Very well, finish me off.” 
__label__twp A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling. 
__label__twp “Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ... at the Razumóvski’s ball ... and Countess Apráksina ... I was so delighted...” came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, “I am so delighted... Mamma’s health... and Countess Apráksina...” and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine’s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pávlovna’s reception. 
__label__twp “I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor. “He is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!” 
__label__twp “What is that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bezúkhov’s distress some fifteen times. 
__label__twp “That’s what comes of a modern education,” exclaimed the visitor. “It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.” 
__label__twp “You don’t say so!” replied the countess. 
__label__twp “He chose his friends badly,” interposed Anna Mikháylovna. “Prince Vasíli’s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. Dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole Kurágin’s father managed somehow to get his son’s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.” 
__label__twp “But what have they been up to?” asked the countess. 
__label__twp “They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov,” replied the visitor. “He is a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!” 
__label__twp “What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!” shouted the count, dying with laughter. 
__label__twp “Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?” 
__label__twp Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing. 
__label__twp “It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,” continued the visitor. “And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters to consider.” 
__label__twp “Why do you say this young man is so rich?” asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. “His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.” 
__label__twp The visitor made a gesture with her hand. 
__label__twp “I should think he has a score of them.” 
__label__twp Princess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society. 
__label__twp “The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly, and also in a half whisper, “everyone knows Count Cyril’s reputation.... He has lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.” 
__label__twp “How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!” remarked the countess. “I have never seen a handsomer man.” 
__label__twp “He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Well, as I was saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death—and he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburg—no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vasíli. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasíli told me himself. Besides, Cyril Vladímirovich is my mother’s second cousin. He’s also my Bóry’s godfather,” she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the fact. 
__label__twp “Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some inspection business,” remarked the visitor. 
__label__twp “Yes, but between ourselves,” said the princess, “that is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladímirovich, hearing how ill he is.” 
__label__twp “But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,” said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young ladies. “I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!” 
__label__twp And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. “So do come and dine with us!” he said. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XI 
__label__twp Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave. The visitor’s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket. 
__label__twp The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in. 
__label__twp “Ah, here she is!” he exclaimed laughing. “My pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!” 
__label__twp “Ma chère, there is a time for everything,” said the countess with feigned severity. “You spoil her, Ilyá,” she added, turning to her husband. 
__label__twp “How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,” said the visitor. “What a charming child,” she added, addressing the mother. 
__label__twp This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers—was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother’s mantilla—not paying the least attention to her severe remark—and began to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock. 
__label__twp “Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...” was all Natásha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in. 
__label__twp “Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,” said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: “She is my youngest girl.” 
__label__twp Natásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother’s mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face. 
__label__twp The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to take some part in it. 
__label__twp “Tell me, my dear,” said she to Natásha, “is Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?” 
__label__twp Natásha did not like the visitor’s tone of condescension to childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously. 
__label__twp Meanwhile the younger generation: Borís, the officer, Anna Mikháylovna’s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count’s eldest son; Sónya, the count’s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Pétya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apráksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter. 
__label__twp The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Borís was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed. Borís on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Natásha. She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Borís did not laugh. 
__label__twp “You were meaning to go out, weren’t you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?” he asked his mother with a smile. 
__label__twp “Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,” she answered, returning his smile. 
__label__twp Borís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha. The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XII 
__label__twp The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countess’ eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were Nicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natásha and Borís, escape from the drawing room. 
__label__twp “Ah yes, my dear,” said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, “his friend Borís has become an officer, and so for friendship’s sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn’t that friendship?” remarked the count in an inquiring tone. 
__label__twp “But they say that war has been declared,” replied the visitor. 
__label__twp “They’ve been saying so a long while,” said the count, “and they’ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, there’s friendship for you,” he repeated. “He’s joining the hussars.” 
__label__twp The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head. 
__label__twp “It’s not at all from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. “It is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.” 
__label__twp He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation. 
__label__twp “Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. It can’t be helped!” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him. 
__label__twp “I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you don’t wish to let me go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.—I don’t know how to hide what I feel.” As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sónya and the young lady visitor. 
__label__twp The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature. 
__label__twp “All right, all right!” said the old count. “He always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,” he added, not noticing his visitor’s sarcastic smile. 
__label__twp The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned to young Rostóv. 
__label__twp “What a pity you weren’t at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday. It was so dull without you,” said she, giving him a tender smile. 
__label__twp The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sónya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas’ animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sónya. 
__label__twp “How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!” said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. “Cousinage—dangereux voisinage,” * she added. 
__label__twp      * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood. 
__label__twp “Yes,” said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, “and how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys.” 
__label__twp “It all depends on the bringing up,” remarked the visitor. 
__label__twp “Yes, you’re quite right,” continued the countess. “Till now I have always, thank God, been my children’s friend and had their full confidence,” said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them. “I know I shall always be my daughters’ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can’t help it), he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.” 
__label__twp “Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,” chimed in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid. “Just fancy: wants to be an hussar. What’s one to do, my dear?” 
__label__twp “What a charming creature your younger girl is,” said the visitor; “a little volcano!” 
__label__twp “Yes, a regular volcano,” said the count. “Takes after me! And what a voice she has; though she’s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say she’ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give her lessons.” 
__label__twp “Isn’t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age.” 
__label__twp “Oh no, not at all too young!” replied the count. “Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.” 
__label__twp “And she’s in love with Borís already. Just fancy!” said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: “Now you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly” (she meant that they would be kissing), “but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter.” 
__label__twp “Yes, I was brought up quite differently,” remarked the handsome elder daughter, Countess Véra, with a smile. 
__label__twp But the smile did not enhance Véra’s beauty as smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression. Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone—the visitors and countess alike—turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward. 
__label__twp “People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,” said the visitor. 
__label__twp “What’s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too clever with Véra,” said the count. “Well, what of that? She’s turned out splendidly all the same,” he added, winking at Véra. 
__label__twp The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner. 
__label__twp “What manners! I thought they would never go,” said the countess, when she had seen her guests out. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XIII 
__label__twp When Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room, waiting for Borís to come out. She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man’s discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly. At this Natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there. 
__label__twp Borís paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face. Natásha, very still, peered out from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natásha was about to call him but changed her mind. “Let him look for me,” thought she. Hardly had Borís gone than Sónya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the other door. Natásha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching—as under an invisible cap—to see what went on in the world. She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sónya, muttering to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas came in. 
__label__twp “Sónya, what is the matter with you? How can you?” said he, running up to her. 
__label__twp “It’s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!” sobbed Sónya. 
__label__twp “Ah, I know what it is.” 
__label__twp “Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!” 
__label__twp “Só-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?” said Nicholas taking her hand. 
__label__twp Sónya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natásha, not stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes. “What will happen now?” thought she. 
__label__twp “Sónya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are everything!” said Nicholas. “And I will prove it to you.” 
__label__twp “I don’t like you to talk like that.” 
__label__twp “Well, then, I won’t; only forgive me, Sónya!” He drew her to him and kissed her. 
__label__twp “Oh, how nice,” thought Natásha; and when Sónya and Nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Borís to her. 
__label__twp “Borís, come here,” said she with a sly and significant look. “I have something to tell you. Here, here!” and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding. 
__label__twp Borís followed her, smiling. 
__label__twp “What is the something?” asked he. 
__label__twp She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up. 
__label__twp “Kiss the doll,” said she. 
__label__twp Borís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply. 
__label__twp “Don’t you want to? Well, then, come here,” said she, and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. “Closer, closer!” she whispered. 
__label__twp She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face. 
__label__twp “And me? Would you like to kiss me?” she whispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from excitement. 
__label__twp Borís blushed. 
__label__twp “How funny you are!” he said, bending down to her and blushing still more, but he waited and did nothing. 
__label__twp Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips. 
__label__twp Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood, hanging her head. 
__label__twp “Natásha,” he said, “you know that I love you, but....” 
__label__twp “You are in love with me?” Natásha broke in. 
__label__twp “Yes, I am, but please don’t let us do like that.... In another four years ... then I will ask for your hand.” 
__label__twp Natásha considered. 
__label__twp “Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,” she counted on her slender little fingers. “All right! Then it’s settled?” 
__label__twp A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face. 
__label__twp “Settled!” replied Borís. 
__label__twp “Forever?” said the little girl. “Till death itself?” 
__label__twp She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XIV 
__label__twp After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came “to congratulate.” The countess wished to have a tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikháylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg. Anna Mikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess. 
__label__twp “With you I will be quite frank,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “There are not many left of us old friends! That’s why I so value your friendship.” 
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused. The countess pressed her friend’s hand. 
__label__twp “Véra,” she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite, “how is it you have so little tact? Don’t you see you are not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...” 
__label__twp The handsome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt. 
__label__twp “If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,” she replied as she rose to go to her own room. 
__label__twp But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sónya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the first he had ever written. Borís and Natásha were at the other window and ceased talking when Véra entered. Sónya and Natásha looked at Véra with guilty, happy faces. 
__label__twp It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra. 
__label__twp “How often have I asked you not to take my things?” she said. “You have a room of your own,” and she took the inkstand from Nicholas. 
__label__twp “In a minute, in a minute,” he said, dipping his pen. 
__label__twp “You always manage to do things at the wrong time,” continued Véra. “You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you.” 
__label__twp Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand. 
__label__twp “And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and Borís, or between you two? It’s all nonsense!” 
__label__twp “Now, Véra, what does it matter to you?” said Natásha in defense, speaking very gently. 
__label__twp She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone. 
__label__twp “Very silly,” said Véra. “I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!” 
__label__twp “All have secrets of their own,” answered Natásha, getting warmer. “We don’t interfere with you and Berg.” 
__label__twp “I should think not,” said Véra, “because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior. But I’ll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with Borís.” 
__label__twp “Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me,” remarked Borís. “I have nothing to complain of.” 
__label__twp “Don’t, Borís! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome,” said Natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly. (She used the word “diplomat,” which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) “Why does she bother me?” And she added, turning to Véra, “You’ll never understand it, because you’ve never loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more” (this nickname, bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), “and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please,” she finished quickly. 
__label__twp “I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...” 
__label__twp “Well, now you’ve done what you wanted,” put in Nicholas—“said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let’s go to the nursery.” 
__label__twp All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room. 
__label__twp “The unpleasant things were said to me,” remarked Véra, “I said none to anyone.” 
__label__twp “Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!” shouted laughing voices through the door. 
__label__twp The handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer. 
__label__twp  In the drawing room the conversation was still going on. 
__label__twp “Ah, my dear,” said the countess, “my life is not all roses either. Don’t I know that at the rate we are living our means won’t last long? It’s all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But don’t let’s talk about me; tell me how you managed everything. I often wonder at you, Annette—how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It’s quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn’t possibly do it.” 
__label__twp “Ah, my love,” answered Anna Mikháylovna, “God grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction! One learns many things then,” she added with a certain pride. “That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those big people I write a note: ‘Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,’ and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times—till I get what I want. I don’t mind what they think of me.” 
__label__twp “Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?” asked the countess. “You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a cadet. There’s no one to interest himself for him. To whom did you apply?” 
__label__twp “To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything, and put the matter before the Emperor,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end. 
__label__twp “Has Prince Vasíli aged much?” asked the countess. “I have not seen him since we acted together at the Rumyántsovs’ theatricals. I expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,” said the countess, with a smile. 
__label__twp “He is just the same as ever,” replied Anna Mikháylovna, “overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head at all. He said to me, ‘I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.’ Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,” continued Anna Mikháylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. “My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don’t know how to equip Borís.” She took out her handkerchief and began to cry. “I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov. If he will not assist his godson—you know he is Bóry’s godfather—and allow him something for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to equip him.” 
__label__twp The countess’ eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence. 
__label__twp “I often think, though, perhaps it’s a sin,” said the princess, “that here lives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It’s a burden to him, and Bóry’s life is only just beginning....” 
__label__twp “Surely he will leave something to Borís,” said the countess. 
__label__twp “Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish. Still, I will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it’s really all the same to me when my son’s fate is at stake.” The princess rose. “It’s now two o’clock and you dine at four. There will just be time.” 
__label__twp And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the anteroom with him. 
__label__twp “Good-by, my dear,” said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, “Wish me good luck.” 
__label__twp “Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?” said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: “If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my dear. We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today. He says Count Orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be!” 
__label__twp CHAPTER XV 
__label__twp “My dear Borís,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as Countess Rostóva’s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s house. “My dear Borís,” said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son’s arm, “be affectionate and attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfather after all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to be.” 
__label__twp “If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it...” answered her son coldly. “But I have promised and will do it for your sake.” 
__label__twp Although the hall porter saw someone’s carriage standing at the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady’s old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone. 
__label__twp “We may as well go back,” said the son in French. 
__label__twp “My dear!” exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him. 
__label__twp Borís said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak. 
__label__twp “My friend,” said Anna Mikháylovna in gentle tones, addressing the hall porter, “I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is very ill... that’s why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my friend... I only need see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich: he is staying here, is he not? Please announce me.” 
__label__twp The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned away. 
__label__twp “Princess Drubetskáya to see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich,” he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing. 
__label__twp The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs. 
__label__twp “My dear,” she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch, “you promised me!” 
__label__twp The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly. 
__label__twp They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince Vasíli. 
__label__twp Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasíli came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast, as was his custom when at home—taking leave of a good-looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain. 
__label__twp “Then it is certain?” said the prince. 
__label__twp “Prince, humanum est errare, * but...” replied the doctor, swallowing his r’s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent. 
__label__twp      * To err is human. 
__label__twp “Very well, very well...” 
__label__twp Seeing Anna Mikháylovna and her son, Prince Vasíli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother’s face, and he smiled slightly. 
__label__twp “Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear invalid?” said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her. 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli stared at her and at Borís questioningly and perplexed. Borís bowed politely. Prince Vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikháylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient. 
__label__twp “Is it possible?” exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna. “Oh, how awful! It is terrible to think.... This is my son,” she added, indicating Borís. “He wanted to thank you himself.” 
__label__twp Borís bowed again politely. 
__label__twp “Believe me, Prince, a mother’s heart will never forget what you have done for us.” 
__label__twp “I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Schérer’s reception. 
__label__twp “Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,” added he, addressing Borís with severity. “I am glad.... Are you here on leave?” he went on in his usual tone of indifference. 
__label__twp “I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,” replied Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince’s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance. 
__label__twp “Are you living with your mother?” 
__label__twp “I am living at Countess Rostóva’s,” replied Borís, again adding, “your excellency.” 
__label__twp “That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who married Nataly Shinshiná,” said Anna Mikháylovna. 
__label__twp “I know, I know,” answered Prince Vasíli in his monotonous voice. “I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told.” 
__label__twp “But a very kind man, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved this censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. “What do the doctors say?” asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again expressing deep sorrow. 
__label__twp “They give little hope,” replied the prince. 
__label__twp “And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and Borís. He is his godson,” she added, her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give Prince Vasíli much satisfaction. 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikháylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezúkhov’s fortune, and hastened to reassure him. 
__label__twp “If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,” said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, “I know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses.... They are still young....” She bent her head and continued in a whisper: “Has he performed his final duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince,” and she smiled tenderly, “always know how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering.” 
__label__twp Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna Pávlovna’s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikháylovna. 
__label__twp “Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikháylovna?” said he. “Let us wait until evening. The doctors are expecting a crisis.” 
__label__twp “But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...” 
__label__twp A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count’s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasíli turned to her. 
__label__twp “Well, how is he?” 
__label__twp “Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...” said the princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger. 
__label__twp “Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count’s niece. “I have come, and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have gone through,” and she sympathetically turned up her eyes. 
__label__twp The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as Anna Mikháylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasíli to take a seat beside her. 
__label__twp “Borís,” she said to her son with a smile, “I shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don’t forget to give him the Rostóvs’ invitation. They ask him to dinner. I suppose he won’t go?” she continued, turning to the prince. 
__label__twp “On the contrary,” replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed, “I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.” 
__label__twp He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Borís down one flight of stairs and up another, to Pierre’s rooms. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XVI 
__label__twp Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father’s house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father—who were never favorably disposed toward him—would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father’s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading—the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern. 
__label__twp “How do you do, cousin?” said Pierre. “You don’t recognize me?” 
__label__twp “I recognize you only too well, too well.” 
__label__twp “How is the count? Can I see him?” asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed. 
__label__twp “The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.” 
__label__twp “Can I see the count?” Pierre again asked. 
__label__twp “Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle’s beef tea is ready—it is almost time,” she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance. 
__label__twp Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and said: “Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see him.” 
__label__twp And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole. 
__label__twp Next day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count’s house. He sent for Pierre and said to him: “My dear fellow, if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must not see him at all.” 
__label__twp Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs. 
__label__twp When Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating. 
__label__twp “England is done for,” said he, scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen. “Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man, is sentenced to...” But before Pierre—who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London—could pronounce Pitt’s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Borís was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Borís by the hand with a friendly smile. 
__label__twp “Do you remember me?” asked Borís quietly with a pleasant smile. “I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.” 
__label__twp “Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,” answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was. 
__label__twp Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face. 
__label__twp “Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today,” said he, after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable. 
__label__twp “Ah, Count Rostóv!” exclaimed Pierre joyfully. “Then you are his son, Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn’t know you at first. Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It’s such an age...” 
__label__twp “You are mistaken,” said Borís deliberately, with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. “I am Borís, son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetskáya. Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.” 
__label__twp Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees. 
__label__twp “Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I’ve mixed everything up. One has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course. Well, now we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn’t make a mess of things!” 
__label__twp Borís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve’s name. 
__label__twp “We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics,” said he in his quiet ironical tone. “I know nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip,” he continued. “Just now they are talking about you and your father.” 
__label__twp Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion’s sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret. But Borís spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre’s eyes. 
__label__twp “Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,” Borís went on. “Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...” 
__label__twp “Yes, it is all very horrid,” interrupted Pierre, “very horrid.” 
__label__twp Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself. 
__label__twp “And it must seem to you,” said Borís flushing slightly, but not changing his tone or attitude, “it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man?” 
__label__twp “So it does,” thought Pierre. 
__label__twp “But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your father is rich, I don’t regard myself as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.” 
__label__twp For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation. 
__label__twp “Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know very well...” 
__label__twp But Borís again interrupted him. 
__label__twp “I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me,” said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him, “but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the Rostóvs’?” 
__label__twp And Borís, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it, became quite pleasant again. 
__label__twp “No, but I say,” said Pierre, calming down, “you are a wonderful fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you don’t know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it’s splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It’s queer,” he added after a pause, “that you should have suspected me!” He began to laugh. “Well, what of it! I hope we’ll get better acquainted,” and he pressed Borís’ hand. “Do you know, I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?” 
__label__twp “And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?” asked Borís with a smile. 
__label__twp Pierre saw that Borís wished to change the subject, and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition. 
__label__twp A footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going. Pierre, in order to make Borís’ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Borís’ eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man. 
__label__twp As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends. 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful. 
__label__twp “It is dreadful, dreadful!” she was saying, “but cost me what it may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be left like this. Every moment is precious. I can’t think why his nieces put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you...” 
__label__twp “Adieu, ma bonne,” answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her. 
__label__twp “Oh, he is in a dreadful state,” said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage. “He hardly recognizes anybody.” 
__label__twp “I don’t understand, Mamma—what is his attitude to Pierre?” asked the son. 
__label__twp “The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.” 
__label__twp “But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?” 
__label__twp “Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!” 
__label__twp “Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...” 
__label__twp “Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!” exclaimed the mother. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XVII 
__label__twp After Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov, Countess Rostóva sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang. 
__label__twp “What is the matter with you, my dear?” she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes. “Don’t you wish to serve me? Then I’ll find you another place.” 
__label__twp The countess was upset by her friend’s sorrow and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid “my dear” and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness. 
__label__twp “I am very sorry, ma’am,” answered the maid. 
__label__twp “Ask the count to come to me.” 
__label__twp The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual. 
__label__twp “Well, little countess? What a sauté of game au madère we are to have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás were not ill-spent. He is worth it!” 
__label__twp He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair. 
__label__twp “What are your commands, little countess?” 
__label__twp “You see, my dear... What’s that mess?” she said, pointing to his waistcoat. “It’s the sauté, most likely,” she added with a smile. “Well, you see, Count, I want some money.” 
__label__twp Her face became sad. 
__label__twp “Oh, little countess!” ... and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook. 
__label__twp “I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,” and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband’s waistcoat. 
__label__twp “Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who’s there?” he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons. “Send Dmítri to me!” 
__label__twp Dmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count’s house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room. 
__label__twp “This is what I want, my dear fellow,” said the count to the deferential young man who had entered. “Bring me...” he reflected a moment, “yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don’t bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess.” 
__label__twp “Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,” said the countess, sighing deeply. 
__label__twp “When would you like them, your excellency?” asked Dmítri. “Allow me to inform you... But, don’t be uneasy,” he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger. “I was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?” 
__label__twp “Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.” 
__label__twp “What a treasure that Dmítri is,” added the count with a smile when the young man had departed. “There is never any ‘impossible’ with him. That’s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.” 
__label__twp “Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,” said the countess. “But I am in great need of this sum.” 
__label__twp “You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the count, and having kissed his wife’s hand he went back to his study. 
__label__twp When Anna Mikháylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov’s the money, all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess’ little table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating her. 
__label__twp “Well, my dear?” asked the countess. 
__label__twp “Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...” 
__label__twp “Annette, for heaven’s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief. 
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment. 
__label__twp “This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.” 
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were kindhearted, and because they—friends from childhood—had to think about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over.... But those tears were pleasant to them both. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XVIII 
__label__twp Countess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From time to time he went out to ask: “Hasn’t she come yet?” They were expecting Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, known in society as le terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank plainness of speech. Márya Dmítrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less all without exception respected and feared her. 
__label__twp In the count’s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other. 
__label__twp One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinshín, a cousin of the countess’, a man with “a sharp tongue” as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semënov regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natásha had teased her elder sister Véra, speaking of Berg as her “intended.” The count sat between them and listened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another. 
__label__twp “Well, then, old chap, mon très honorable Alphonse Kárlovich,” said Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a peculiarity of his speech. “Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l’état; * you want to make something out of your company?” 
__label__twp      * You expect to make an income out of the government. 
__label__twp “No, Peter Nikoláevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own position now, Peter Nikoláevich...” 
__label__twp Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction. 
__label__twp “Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich. Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty,” said he, looking at Shinshín and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else. 
__label__twp “Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position,” continued Berg, “and vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father,” he went on, emitting a smoke ring. 
__label__twp “La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the proverb says,” remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count. 
__label__twp       * So that squares matters. 
__label__twp The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinshín was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers. 
__label__twp “Well, my boy, you’ll get along wherever you go—foot or horse—that I’ll warrant,” said Shinshín, patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa. 
__label__twp Berg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the drawing room. 
__label__twp It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests, expecting the summons to zakúska, * avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are waiting for—some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready. 
__label__twp      * Hors d’oeuvres. 
__label__twp Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman. 
__label__twp “You have only lately arrived?” the countess asked him. 
__label__twp “Oui, madame,” replied he, looking around him. 
__label__twp “You have not yet seen my husband?” 
__label__twp “Non, madame.” He smiled quite inappropriately. 
__label__twp “You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it’s very interesting.” 
__label__twp “Very interesting.” 
__label__twp The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna. The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other guests were all conversing with one another. “The Razumóvskis... It was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apráksina...” was heard on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom. 
__label__twp “Márya Dmítrievna?” came her voice from there. 
__label__twp “Herself,” came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya Dmítrievna entered the room. 
__label__twp All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose. Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout, holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up. Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian. 
__label__twp “Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children,” she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all others. “Well, you old sinner,” she went on, turning to the count who was kissing her hand, “you’re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up,” and she pointed to the girls. “You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....” 
__label__twp “Well,” said she, “how’s my Cossack?” (Márya Dmítrievna always called Natásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child’s arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. “I know she’s a scamp of a girl, but I like her.” 
__label__twp She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed with the pleasure of her saint’s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre. 
__label__twp “Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,” said she, assuming a soft high tone of voice. “Come here, my friend...” and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles. 
__label__twp “Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it’s my evident duty.” She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for this was clearly only a prelude. 
__label__twp “A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.” 
__label__twp She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep from laughing. 
__label__twp “Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?” said Márya Dmítrievna. 
__label__twp The count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikháylovna with Shinshín. Berg gave his arm to Véra. The smiling Julie Karágina went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count’s household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna Mikháylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the grown-up young people: Véra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Borís; and on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors’ glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies’ end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men’s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling. Borís was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha, who was sitting opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the next man’s shoulders and whispered: “Dry Madeira”... “Hungarian”... or “Rhine wine” as the case might be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count’s monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests. Natásha, who sat opposite, was looking at Borís as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl’s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why. 
__label__twp Nicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sónya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XIX 
__label__twp At the men’s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief. 
__label__twp “And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?” remarked Shinshín. “He has stopped Austria’s cackle and I fear it will be our turn next.” 
__label__twp The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshín’s remark. 
__label__twp “It is for the reasson, my goot sir,” said he, speaking with a German accent, “for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances...” he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter. 
__label__twp Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto: 
__label__twp ... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor’s sole and absolute aim—to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations—has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose. 
__label__twp “Zat, my dear sir, is vy...” he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval. 
__label__twp “Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* ‘Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn spindles at home!’?” said Shinshín, puckering his brows and smiling. “Cela nous convient à merveille.*(2) Suvórov now—he knew what he was about; yet they beat him à plate couture,*(3) and where are we to find Suvórovs now? Je vous demande un peu,” *(4) said he, continually changing from French to Russian. 
__label__twp      *Do you know the proverb? 
__label__twp      *(2) That suits us down to the ground. 
__label__twp      *(3) Hollow. 
__label__twp      *(4) I just ask you that. 
__label__twp “Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!” said the colonel, thumping the table; “and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible”... he dwelt particularly on the word possible... “as po-o-ossible,” he ended, again turning to the count. “Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere’s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it?” he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel. 
__label__twp “I am quite of your opinion,” replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger. “I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,” he concluded, conscious—as were others—after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward. 
__label__twp “What you said just now was splendid!” said his partner Julie. 
__label__twp Sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking. 
__label__twp Pierre listened to the colonel’s speech and nodded approvingly. 
__label__twp “That’s fine,” said he. 
__label__twp “The young man’s a real hussar!” shouted the colonel, again thumping the table. 
__label__twp “What are you making such a noise about over there?” Márya Dmítrievna’s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table. “What are you thumping the table for?” she demanded of the hussar, “and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?” 
__label__twp “I am speaking ze truce,” replied the hussar with a smile. 
__label__twp “It’s all about the war,” the count shouted down the table. “You know my son’s going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going.” 
__label__twp “I have four sons in the army but still I don’t fret. It is all in God’s hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,” replied Márya Dmítrievna’s deep voice, which easily carried the whole length of the table. 
__label__twp “That’s true!” 
__label__twp Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies’ at the one end and the men’s at the other. 
__label__twp “You won’t ask,” Natásha’s little brother was saying; “I know you won’t ask!” 
__label__twp “I will,” replied Natásha. 
__label__twp Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother: 
__label__twp “Mamma!” rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice, audible the whole length of the table. 
__label__twp “What is it?” asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter’s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head. 
__label__twp The conversation was hushed. 
__label__twp “Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” and Natásha’s voice sounded still more firm and resolute. 
__label__twp The countess tried to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrievna shook her fat finger. 
__label__twp “Cossack!” she said threateningly. 
__label__twp Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the elders. 
__label__twp “You had better take care!” said the countess. 
__label__twp “Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” Natásha again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good part. 
__label__twp Sónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter. 
__label__twp “You see! I have asked,” whispered Natásha to her little brother and to Pierre, glancing at him again. 
__label__twp “Ice pudding, but you won’t get any,” said Márya Dmítrievna. 
__label__twp Natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Márya Dmítrievna. 
__label__twp “Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don’t like ice cream.” 
__label__twp “Carrot ices.” 
__label__twp “No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?” she almost screamed; “I want to know!” 
__label__twp Márya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna’s answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion. 
__label__twp Natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, went up to “congratulate” the countess, and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count’s study. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XX 
__label__twp The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count’s visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the sitting room, some in the library. 
__label__twp The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything. The young people, at the countess’ instigation, gathered round the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natásha and Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing something. Natásha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy. 
__label__twp “What shall we sing?” she said. 
__label__twp “‘The Brook,’” suggested Nicholas. 
__label__twp “Well, then, let’s be quick. Borís, come here,” said Natásha. “But where is Sónya?” 
__label__twp She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her. 
__label__twp Running into Sónya’s room and not finding her there, Natásha ran to the nursery, but Sónya was not there either. Natásha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv household. And there in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse’s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. Natásha’s face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint’s day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped. 
__label__twp “Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!” And Natásha’s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya was crying. Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sónya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining. 
__label__twp “Nicholas is going away in a week’s time, his... papers... have come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,” and she showed a paper she held in her hand—with the verses Nicholas had written, “still, I should not cry, but you can’t... no one can understand... what a soul he has!” 
__label__twp And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul. 
__label__twp “It’s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Borís also,” she went on, gaining a little strength; “he is nice... there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it can’t be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma” (Sónya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so) “that I am spoiling Nicholas’ career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness,” and she made the sign of the cross, “I love her so much, and all of you, only Véra... And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing....” 
__label__twp Sónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed. Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend’s trouble. 
__label__twp “Sónya,” she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend’s sorrow, “I’m sure Véra has said something to you since dinner? Hasn’t she?” 
__label__twp “Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and she found them on my table and said she’d show them to Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me, but that he’ll marry Julie. You see how he’s been with her all day... Natásha, what have I done to deserve it?...” 
__label__twp And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natásha lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her. 
__label__twp “Sónya, don’t believe her, darling! Don’t believe her! Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don’t quite remember how, but don’t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? There’s Uncle Shinshín’s brother has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know. And Borís says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about it. And he is so clever and so good!” said Natásha. “Don’t you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!” and she kissed her and laughed. “Véra’s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she won’t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he doesn’t care at all for Julie.” 
__label__twp Natásha kissed her on the hair. 
__label__twp Sónya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should. 
__label__twp “Do you think so?... Really? Truly?” she said, quickly smoothing her frock and hair. 
__label__twp “Really, truly!” answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend’s plaits. 
__label__twp Both laughed. 
__label__twp “Well, let’s go and sing ‘The Brook.’” 
__label__twp “Come along!” 
__label__twp “Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!” said Natásha, stopping suddenly. “I feel so happy!” 
__label__twp And she set off at a run along the passage. 
__label__twp Sónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after Natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light, joyous steps. At the visitors’ request the young people sang the quartette, “The Brook,” with which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned: 
__label__twp    At nighttime in the moon’s fair glow      How sweet, as fancies wander free,    To feel that in this world there’s one      Who still is thinking but of thee! 
__label__twp    That while her fingers touch the harp      Wafting sweet music o’er the lea,    It is for thee thus swells her heart,      Sighing its message out to thee... 
__label__twp    A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,      But oh! till then I cannot live!... 
__label__twp He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery. 
__label__twp  Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began Natásha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and blushing: 
__label__twp “Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.” 
__label__twp “I am afraid of mixing the figures,” Pierre replied; “but if you will be my teacher...” And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl. 
__label__twp While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up, Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natásha was perfectly happy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan. 
__label__twp “Dear, dear! Just look at her!” exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natásha. 
__label__twp Natásha blushed and laughed. 
__label__twp “Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?” 
__label__twp  In the midst of the third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya Dmítrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First came Márya Dmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Márya Dmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the écossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first violin: 
__label__twp “Semën! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?” 
__label__twp This was the count’s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.) 
__label__twp “Look at Papa!” shouted Natásha to the whole company, and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter. 
__label__twp And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, Márya Dmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs—the men on one side and the women on the other—who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry. 
__label__twp “Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!” loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways. 
__label__twp The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed by the whole of the count’s plump figure, in Márya Dmítrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Márya Dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions—the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot—which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could not attract a moment’s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were watching the count and Márya Dmítrievna. Natásha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to “look at Papa!” though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by Natásha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs. 
__label__twp “That’s how we used to dance in our time, ma chère,” said the count. 
__label__twp “That was a Daniel Cooper!” exclaimed Márya Dmítrievna, tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XXI 
__label__twp While in the Rostóvs’ ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezúkhov had a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the count’s health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine’s court, Count Bezúkhov. 
__label__twp The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince Vasíli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in low tones. 
__label__twp When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess. 
__label__twp Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man’s room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened. 
__label__twp “The limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be o’erpassed,” said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naïvely to his words. 
__label__twp “I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?” asked the lady, adding the priest’s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject. 
__label__twp “Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament,” replied the priest, passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head. 
__label__twp “Who was that? The Military Governor himself?” was being asked at the other side of the room. “How young-looking he is!” 
__label__twp “Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.” 
__label__twp “I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.” 
__label__twp The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table. 
__label__twp “Beautiful,” said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather. “The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow one feels as if one were in the country.” 
__label__twp “Yes, indeed,” replied the princess with a sigh. “So he may have something to drink?” 
__label__twp Lorrain considered. 
__label__twp “Has he taken his medicine?” 
__label__twp “Yes.” 
__label__twp The doctor glanced at his watch. 
__label__twp “Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,” and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch. 
__label__twp “Dere has neffer been a gase,” a German doctor was saying to an aide-de-camp, “dat one liffs after de sird stroke.” 
__label__twp “And what a well-preserved man he was!” remarked the aide-de-camp. “And who will inherit his wealth?” he added in a whisper. 
__label__twp “It von’t go begging,” replied the German with a smile. 
__label__twp Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain’s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain. 
__label__twp “Do you think he can last till morning?” asked the German, addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly. 
__label__twp Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before his nose. 
__label__twp “Tonight, not later,” said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient’s condition. 
__label__twp Meanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess’ room. 
__label__twp In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark. 
__label__twp “Ah, is it you, cousin?” 
__label__twp She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish. 
__label__twp “Has anything happened?” she asked. “I am so terrified.” 
__label__twp “No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business, Catiche,” * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated. “You have made the place warm, I must say,” he remarked. “Well, sit down: let’s have a talk.” 
__label__twp      *Catherine. 
__label__twp “I thought perhaps something had happened,” she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she prepared to listen. 
__label__twp “I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can’t.” 
__label__twp “Well, my dear?” said Prince Vasíli, taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit. 
__label__twp It was plain that this “well?” referred to much that they both understood without naming. 
__label__twp The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness. 
__label__twp “And I?” he said; “do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very serious talk.” 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm. 
__label__twp The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasíli’s eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning. 
__label__twp “Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semënovna,” continued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme, apparently not without an inner struggle; “at such a moment as this one must think of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, like children of my own, as you know.” 
__label__twp The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same dull expression. 
__label__twp “And then of course my family has also to be considered,” Prince Vasíli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. “You know, Catiche, that we—you three sisters, Mámontov, and my wife—are the count’s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,” pointing to his portrait, “definitely demanded that he should be called.” 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him. 
__label__twp “There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,” she replied, “and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this...” 
__label__twp “Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away. “But... in short, the fact is... you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.” 
__label__twp “He has made wills enough!” quietly remarked the princess. “But he cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.” 
__label__twp “But, my dear,” said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: “what if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre’s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the count’s services, his request would be granted?...” 
__label__twp The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with. 
__label__twp “I can tell you more,” continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand, “that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is over,” and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over, “and the count’s papers are opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.” 
__label__twp “And our share?” asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything might happen, only not that. 
__label__twp “But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the legal heir to everything and you won’t get anything. You must know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...” 
__label__twp “What next?” the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes. “I am a woman, and you think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit... un bâtard!”* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of his contention. 
__label__twp      * A bastard. 
__label__twp “Well, really, Catiche! Can’t you understand! You are so intelligent, how is it you don’t see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezúkhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s’ensuit!* That’s certain.” 
__label__twp      * And all that follows therefrom. 
__label__twp “I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,” said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging. 
__label__twp “My dear Princess Catherine Semënovna,” began Prince Vasíli impatiently, “I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre’s favor are among the count’s papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don’t believe me, then believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich” (the family solicitor) “and he says the same.” 
__label__twp At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess’ ideas; her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect. 
__label__twp “That would be a fine thing!” said she. “I never wanted anything and I don’t now.” 
__label__twp She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress. 
__label__twp “And this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake!” she cried. “It’s splendid! Fine! I don’t want anything, Prince.” 
__label__twp “Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...” replied Prince Vasíli. 
__label__twp But the princess did not listen to him. 
__label__twp “Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude—the blackest ingratitude—in this house...” 
__label__twp “Do you or do you not know where that will is?” insisted Prince Vasíli, his cheeks twitching more than ever. 
__label__twp “Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has been intriguing!” 
__label__twp The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race. She gave her companion an angry glance. 
__label__twp “There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...” 
__label__twp “Who sacrificed everything for him,” chimed in the princess, who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, “though he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,” she added with a sigh, “I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one has to be cunning and cruel.” 
__label__twp “Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.” 
__label__twp “No, I have a wicked heart.” 
__label__twp “I know your heart,” repeated the prince. “I value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don’t upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it. You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him and you.” 
__label__twp “Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing—I know!” cried the princess. 
__label__twp “That’s not the point, my dear.” 
__label__twp “It’s that protégé of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskáya, that Anna Mikháylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous, vile woman!” 
__label__twp “Do not let us lose any time...” 
__label__twp “Ah, don’t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about Sophie—I can’t repeat them—that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.” 
__label__twp “We’ve got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it sooner?” 
__label__twp “It’s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,” said the princess, ignoring his question. “Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!” almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed. “And what does she come worming herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time will come!” 
__label__twp CHAPTER XXII 
__label__twp While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess’ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikháylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving into the court of Count Bezúkhov’s house. As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikháylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikháylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. “It seems to be all right,” Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikháylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna’s air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there. 
__label__twp “Is this the way to the princesses’ apartments?” asked Anna Mikháylovna of one of them. 
__label__twp “Yes,” replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now permissible; “the door to the left, ma’am.” 
__label__twp “Perhaps the count did not ask for me,” said Pierre when he reached the landing. “I’d better go to my own room.” 
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up. 
__label__twp “Ah, my friend!” she said, touching his arm as she had done her son’s when speaking to him that afternoon, “believe me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!” 
__label__twp “But really, hadn’t I better go away?” he asked, looking kindly at her over his spectacles. 
__label__twp “Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you. Think that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.” She sighed. “I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.” 
__label__twp Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikháylovna who was already opening a door. 
__label__twp This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms. Anna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as “my dear” and “my sweet,” asked about the princess’ health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left led into the princesses’ apartments. The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasíli drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might. 
__label__twp This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince Vasíli’s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected. 
__label__twp “Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,” said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage. 
__label__twp Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what “watching over his interests” meant, but he decided that all these things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count’s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikháylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her. 
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna’s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count’s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest. 
__label__twp “God be thanked that you are in time,” said she to one of the priests; “all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man is the count’s son,” she added more softly. “What a terrible moment!” 
__label__twp Having said this she went up to the doctor. 
__label__twp “Dear doctor,” said she, “this young man is the count’s son. Is there any hope?” 
__label__twp The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders. Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice, she said: 
__label__twp “Trust in His mercy!” and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it. 
__label__twp Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikháylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady’s chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him. 
__label__twp Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on. 
__label__twp “Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is well!” and he turned to go. 
__label__twp But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: “How is...” and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man “the count,” yet ashamed to call him “father.” 
__label__twp “He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my friend...” 
__label__twp Pierre’s mind was in such a confused state that the word “stroke” suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasíli in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness. Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last Anna Mikháylovna, still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said: 
__label__twp “The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered. Come.” 
__label__twp Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XXIII 
__label__twp Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw—covered to the waist by a bright green quilt—the familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezúkhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round. Anna Mikháylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the strange lady. Prince Vasíli in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God. “If you do not understand these sentiments,” he seemed to be saying, “so much the worse for you!” 
__label__twp Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants; the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikháylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper. 
__label__twp Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count’s hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikháylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli left the chair on which he had been leaning, and—with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them—did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vasíli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential. 
__label__twp The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which Anna Mikháylovna’s was the most distinct. 
__label__twp Pierre heard her say: 
__label__twp “Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be impossible...” 
__label__twp The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane—which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him. 
__label__twp “Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper. “Catch hold from underneath. Here!” exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them. 
__label__twp As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man’s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly, leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing. 
__label__twp After a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikháylovna touched Pierre’s hand and said, “Come.” Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man’s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count’s face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna Mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right. Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the naïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierre’s face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count’s face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick man’s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasíli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed. 
__label__twp “Wants to turn on the other side,” whispered the servant, and got up to turn the count’s heavy body toward the wall. 
__label__twp Pierre rose to help him. 
__label__twp While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre’s terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall. He sighed. 
__label__twp “He is dozing,” said Anna Mikháylovna, observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. “Let us go.” 
__label__twp Pierre went out. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XXIV 
__label__twp There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered: 
__label__twp “I can’t bear the sight of that woman.” 
__label__twp “Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,” said Prince Vasíli to Anna Mikháylovna. “Go and take something, my poor Anna Mikháylovna, or you will not hold out.” 
__label__twp To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small drawing room. 
__label__twp “There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea,” Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count Bezúkhov’s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna Mikháylovna was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers. 
__label__twp “Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not necessary,” said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room. 
__label__twp “But, my dear princess,” answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing, “won’t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared...” 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying. 
__label__twp “Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You know how fond the count is of her.” 
__label__twp “I don’t even know what is in this paper,” said the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand. “All I know is that his real will is in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....” 
__label__twp She tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar her path. 
__label__twp “I know, my dear, kind princess,” said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily. “Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous en conjure...” 
__label__twp The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikháylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness. 
__label__twp “Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation; is it not so, Prince?” 
__label__twp “Why don’t you speak, cousin?” suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. “Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man’s room? Intriguer!” she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio. 
__label__twp But Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio, and changed her grip. 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli rose. “Oh!” said he with reproach and surprise, “this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.” 
__label__twp The princess let go. 
__label__twp “And you too!” 
__label__twp But Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him. 
__label__twp “Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?” 
__label__twp “But, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna, “after such a solemn sacrament, allow him a moment’s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion,” said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasíli. 
__label__twp “Remember that you will answer for the consequences,” said Prince Vasíli severely. “You don’t know what you are doing.” 
__label__twp “Vile woman!” shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her. 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands. 
__label__twp At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands. 
__label__twp “What are you doing!” she cried vehemently. “He is dying and you leave me alone with him!” 
__label__twp Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikháylovna, stooping, quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves, followed her. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred. 
__label__twp “Yes, now you may be glad!” said she; “this is what you have been waiting for.” And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room. 
__label__twp Prince Vasíli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague. 
__label__twp “Ah, my friend!” said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before. “How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is awful...” and he burst into tears. 
__label__twp Anna Mikháylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps. 
__label__twp “Pierre!” she said. 
__label__twp Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said: 
__label__twp “He is no more....” 
__label__twp Pierre looked at her over his spectacles. 
__label__twp “Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.” 
__label__twp She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face. Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm. 
__label__twp In the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre: 
__label__twp “Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.” 
__label__twp Pierre was silent. 
__label__twp “Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Borís. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father’s wish?” 
__label__twp Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikháylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs’ and went to bed. On waking in the morning she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bezúkhov’s death. She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments—the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father. “It is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,” said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasíli she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XXV 
__label__twp At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andréevich Bolkónski’s estate, the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince’s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich (nicknamed in society, “the King of Prussia”) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice—idleness and superstition, and only two virtues—activity and intelligence. He himself undertook his daughter’s education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the prince’s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes. 
__label__twp On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well. 
__label__twp An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper: “Please walk in.” 
__label__twp Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work. 
__label__twp The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around—all indicated continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively, said severely: 
__label__twp “Quite well? All right then, sit down.” He took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot. 
__label__twp “For tomorrow!” said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail. 
__label__twp The princess bent over the exercise book on the table. 
__label__twp “Wait a bit, here’s a letter for you,” said the old man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in a woman’s hand from a bag hanging above the table, onto which he threw it. 
__label__twp At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess’ face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it. 
__label__twp “From Héloïse?” asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound, yellowish teeth. 
__label__twp “Yes, it’s from Julie,” replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile. 
__label__twp “I’ll let two more letters pass, but the third I’ll read,” said the prince sternly; “I’m afraid you write much nonsense. I’ll read the third!” 
__label__twp “Read this if you like, Father,” said the princess, blushing still more and holding out the letter. 
__label__twp “The third, I said the third!” cried the prince abruptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figures. 
__label__twp “Well, madam,” he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. “Now, madam, these triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...” 
__label__twp The princess looked in a scared way at her father’s eyes glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father’s further explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the teacher’s fault or the pupil’s, this same thing happened every day: the princess’ eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern father’s withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away. 
__label__twp The princess gave a wrong answer. 
__label__twp “Well now, isn’t she a fool!” shouted the prince, pushing the book aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and down, lightly touched his daughter’s hair and sat down again. 
__label__twp He drew up his chair, and continued to explain. 
__label__twp “This won’t do, Princess; it won’t do,” said he, when Princess Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day’s lesson, was about to leave: “Mathematics are most important, madam! I don’t want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and you’ll like it,” and he patted her cheek. “It will drive all the nonsense out of your head.” 
__label__twp She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk. 
__label__twp “Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Héloïse has sent you. Religious! I don’t interfere with anyone’s belief... I have looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.” 
__label__twp He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her. 
__label__twp Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Karágina who had been at the Rostóvs’ name-day party. 
__label__twp Julie wrote in French: 
__label__twp Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write? 
__label__twp Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass. “She flatters me,” thought the princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter her friend, the princess’ eyes—large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)—were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes—the look they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on reading: 
__label__twp All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostóv, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much. Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then. That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old Count Bezúkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vasíli nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezúkhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince Vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen. 
__label__twp I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezúkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don’t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezúkhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post. À propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikháylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasíli’s son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguée, and it is on you that his relations’ choice has fallen. I don’t know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find out about him. 
__label__twp But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins’. Read the mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you. 
__label__twp JULIE 
__label__twp P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife. 
__label__twp The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote, also in French: 
__label__twp Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian love, love of one’s neighbor, love of one’s enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself. 
__label__twp The news of Count Bezúkhov’s death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune! 
__label__twp I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince Vasíli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviour’s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vasíli but am still more sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened with such riches—to what temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit. 
__label__twp My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasíli. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband. 
__label__twp I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one, however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you are—at the heart of affairs and of the world—is the talk all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature—which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country—rumors of war are heard and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of injuries—and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another. 
__label__twp Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care! 
__label__twp MARY 
__label__twp “Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched mine. I have written to my poor mother,” said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r’s. She brought into Princess Mary’s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied. 
__label__twp “Princess, I must warn you,” she added, lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement, “the prince has been scolding Michael Ivánovich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.” 
__label__twp “Ah, dear friend,” replied Princess Mary, “I have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so.” 
__label__twp The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o’clock, as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord. 
__label__twp CHAPTER XXVI 
__label__twp The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty times repeated—of a sonata by Dussek. 
__label__twp Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old Tíkhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door. Tíkhon knew that neither the son’s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tíkhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father’s habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he turned to his wife. 
__label__twp “He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary’s room,” he said. 
__label__twp The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever. 
__label__twp “Why, this is a palace!” she said to her husband, looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball. “Let’s come, quick, quick!” And with a glance round, she smiled at Tíkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them. 
__label__twp “Is that Mary practicing? Let’s go quietly and take her by surprise.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression. 
__label__twp “You’ve grown older, Tíkhon,” he said in passing to the old man, who kissed his hand. 
__label__twp Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight. 
__label__twp “Ah! what joy for the princess!” exclaimed she: “At last! I must let her know.” 
__label__twp “No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,” said the little princess, kissing her. “I know you already through my sister-in-law’s friendship for you. She was not expecting us?” 
__label__twp They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant. 
__label__twp The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary’s heavy tread and the sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other’s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other’s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew’s surprise both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting. 
__label__twp “Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...” they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed. “I dreamed last night...”—“You were not expecting us?...” “Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?...” “And you have grown stouter!...” 
__label__twp “I knew the princess at once,” put in Mademoiselle Bourienne. 
__label__twp “And I had no idea!...” exclaimed Princess Mary. “Ah, Andrew, I did not see you.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince Andrew’s face. 
__label__twp The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had had on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odýntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law’s words. In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother: 
__label__twp “So you are really going to the war, Andrew?” she said sighing. 
__label__twp Lise sighed too. 
__label__twp “Yes, and even tomorrow,” replied her brother. 
__label__twp “He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had promotion...” 
__label__twp Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure. 
__label__twp “Is it certain?” she said. 
__label__twp The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: “Yes, quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...” 
__label__twp Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law’s and unexpectedly again began to cry. 
__label__twp “She needs rest,” said Prince Andrew with a frown. “Don’t you, Lise? Take her to your room and I’ll go to Father. How is he? Just the same?” 
__label__twp “Yes, just the same. Though I don’t know what your opinion will be,” answered the princess joyfully. 
__label__twp “And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the lathe?” asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses. 
__label__twp “The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons,” said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life. 
__label__twp When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father. The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son’s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his father’s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon. 
__label__twp “Ah! here’s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?” said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tíkhon was holding fast to plait, would allow. 
__label__twp “You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this he’ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?” And he held out his cheek. 
__label__twp The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He used to say that a nap “after dinner was silver—before dinner, golden.”) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father’s favorite topic—making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte. 
__label__twp “Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,” said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father’s face with an eager and respectful look. “How is your health?” 
__label__twp “Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.” 
__label__twp “Thank God,” said his son smiling. 
__label__twp “God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,” he continued, returning to his hobby; “tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call ‘strategy.’” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew smiled. 
__label__twp “Give me time to collect my wits, Father,” said he, with a smile that showed that his father’s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him. “Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!” 
__label__twp “Nonsense, nonsense!” cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. “The house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and show her over, and they’ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That’s their woman’s way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson’s army I understand—Tolstóy ‘s too... a simultaneous expedition.... But what’s the southern army to do? Prussia is neutral... I know that. What about Austria?” said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tíkhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles of clothing. “What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began—at first reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on—to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: “The white one, the white one!” 
__label__twp This meant that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying: 
__label__twp “And will she soon be confined?” and shaking his head reproachfully said: “That’s bad! Go on, go on.” 
__label__twp The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age: “Malbrook s’en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.” * 
__label__twp      * “Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he’ll      return.” 
__label__twp  His son only smiled. 
__label__twp “I don’t say it’s a plan I approve of,” said the son; “I am only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than this one.” 
__label__twp “Well, you’ve told me nothing new,” and the old man repeated, meditatively and rapidly: 
__label__twp “Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.” 
__label__twp CHAPTER XXVII 
__label__twp At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a strange caprice of his employer’s was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivánovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich was “not a whit worse than you or I.” At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivánovich more often than to anyone else. 
__label__twp In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen—one behind each chair—stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkónski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown—an alleged descendant of Rúrik and ancestor of the Bolkónskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing. 
__label__twp “How thoroughly like him that is!” he said to Princess Mary, who had come up to him. 
__label__twp Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question. 
__label__twp “Everyone has his Achilles’ heel,” continued Prince Andrew. “Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!” 
__label__twp Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother’s criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck. 
__label__twp “I’m glad, glad, to see you,” he said, looking attentively into her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. “Sit down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ivánovich!” 
__label__twp He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved the chair for her. 
__label__twp “Ho, ho!” said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure. “You’ve been in a hurry. That’s bad!” 
__label__twp He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and not with his eyes. 
__label__twp “You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,” he said. 
__label__twp The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip. 
__label__twp “Countess Apráksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out,” she said, growing more and more lively. 
__label__twp As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivánovich. 
__label__twp “Well, Michael Ivánovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it. Prince Andrew” (he always spoke thus of his son) “has been telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I never thought much of him.” 
__label__twp Michael Ivánovich did not at all know when “you and I” had said such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince’s favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow. 
__label__twp “He is a great tactician!” said the prince to his son, pointing to the architect. 
__label__twp And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Potëmkins or Suvórovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing, pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father’s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure. 
__label__twp “The past always seems good,” said he, “but did not Suvórov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?” 
__label__twp “Who told you that? Who?” cried the prince. “Suvórov!” And he jerked away his plate, which Tíkhon briskly caught. “Suvórov!... Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvórov; Moreau!... Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand; but he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you’ll find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvórov couldn’t manage them so what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No, my dear boy,” he continued, “you and your generals won’t get on against Buonaparte; you’ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,” he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... “Wonderful!... Were the Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and Orlóvs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you, but we’ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!...” 
__label__twp “I don’t at all say that all the plans are good,” said Prince Andrew, “I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!” 
__label__twp “Michael Ivánovich!” cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: “Didn’t I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.” 
__label__twp “To be sure, your excellency,” replied the architect. 
__label__twp The prince again laughed his frigid laugh. 
__label__twp “Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody has beaten the Germans. They beat no one—except one another. He made his reputation fighting them.” 
__label__twp And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political events. 
__label__twp “You think I’m an old man and don’t understand the present state of affairs?” concluded his father. “But it troubles me. I don’t sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?” he concluded. 
__label__twp “That would take too long to tell,” answered the son. 
__label__twp “Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here’s another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,” he exclaimed in excellent French. 
__label__twp “You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!” 
__label__twp “Dieu sait quand reviendra.” hummed the prince out of tune and, with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table. 
__label__twp The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she took her sister-in-law’s arm and drew her into another room. 
__label__twp “What a clever man your father is,” said she; “perhaps that is why I am afraid of him.” 
__label__twp “Oh, he is so kind!” answered Princess Mary. 
__label__twp Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in her sister-in-law’s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him. After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber—a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochákov. All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew’s were in very good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes. 
__label__twp When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew’s face looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?—perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard. 
__label__twp “I hear you have given orders to harness,” she cried, panting (she had apparently been running), “and I did so wish to have another talk with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,” she added, as if to explain such a question. 
__label__twp She smiled as she uttered his pet name, “Andrúsha.” It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrúsha—the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood. 
__label__twp “And where is Lise?” he asked, answering her question only by a smile. 
__label__twp “She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room. Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,” said she, sitting down on the sofa, facing her brother. “She is quite a child: such a dear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face. 
__label__twp “One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them, Andrew? Don’t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into everyone’s situation. Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner. * Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her condition! It’s very hard.” 
__label__twp Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand. 
__label__twp “You live in the country and don’t think the life terrible,” he replied. 
__label__twp “I... that’s different. Why speak of me? I don’t want any other life, and can’t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life, all alone—for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....” 
__label__twp “I don’t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,” said Prince Andrew. 
__label__twp “No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she’s much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don’t need her, and she’s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: ‘We don’t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.’ Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.” 
__label__twp “To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father’s character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn’t it?” Prince Andrew asked suddenly. 
__label__twp Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question. 
__label__twp “For me? For me?... Trying for me!...” said she. 
__label__twp “He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he’s getting very trying,” said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister. 
__label__twp “You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,” said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation—“and that’s a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am.” 
__label__twp Her brother shook his head incredulously. 
__label__twp “The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth, Andrew... is Father’s way of treating religious subjects. I don’t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with.” 
__label__twp “Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder,” said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly. 
__label__twp “Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me. Andrew...” she said timidly after a moment’s silence, “I have a great favor to ask of you.” 
__label__twp “What is it, dear?” 
__label__twp “No—promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise, Andrúsha!...” said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted. 
__label__twp She looked timidly at her brother. 
__label__twp “Even if it were a great deal of trouble...” answered Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it was about. 
__label__twp “Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father’s father, our grandfather, wore it in all his wars.” (She still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule.) “So you promise?” 
__label__twp “Of course. What is it?” 
__label__twp “Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off. Do you promise?” 
__label__twp “If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won’t break my neck... To please you...” said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister’s face, he repented and added: “I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.” 
__label__twp “Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,” said she in a voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver chain. 
__label__twp She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew. 
__label__twp “Please, Andrew, for my sake!...” 
__label__twp Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face. 
__label__twp “Thank you, my dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa. They were silent for a while. 
__label__twp “As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always used to be. Don’t judge Lise harshly,” she began. “She is so sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.” 
__label__twp “I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or blamed her. Why do you say all this to me?” 
__label__twp Red patches appeared on Princess Mary’s face and she was silent as if she felt guilty. 
__label__twp “I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And I am sorry for that,” he went on. 
__label__twp The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister. 
__label__twp “Know this, Másha: I can’t reproach, have not reproached, and never shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is so I don’t know...” 
__label__twp As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway. 
__label__twp “Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or—go and wake and I’ll come in a moment. Petrúshka!” he called to his valet: “Come here, take these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.” 
__label__twp Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said: “Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been answered.” 
__label__twp “Well, maybe!” said Prince Andrew. “Go, Másha; I’ll come immediately.” 
__label__twp On the way to his sister’s room, in the passage which connected one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages. 
__label__twp “Oh! I thought you were in your room,” she said, for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes. 
__label__twp Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his sister’s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying one word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make up for lost time. 
__label__twp “No, but imagine the old Countess Zúbova, with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!” 
__label__twp This very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey. She answered him and continued her chatter. 
__label__twp The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole. Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael Ivánovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his father’s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All were waiting for them to come out. 
__label__twp When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round. 
__label__twp “Going?” And he went on writing. 
__label__twp “I’ve come to say good-by.” 
__label__twp “Kiss me here,” and he touched his cheek: “Thanks, thanks!” 
__label__twp “What do you thank me for?” 
__label__twp “For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman’s apron strings. The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!” And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. “If you have anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,” he added. 
__label__twp “About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands....” 
__label__twp “Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.” 
__label__twp “When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let him be here....” 
__label__twp The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his son. 
__label__twp “I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,” said Prince Andrew, evidently confused. “I know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.” 
__label__twp “Hm... Hm...” muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was writing. “I’ll do it.” 
__label__twp He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh. 
__label__twp “It’s a bad business, eh?” 
__label__twp “What is bad, Father?” 
__label__twp “The wife!” said the old prince, briefly and significantly. 
__label__twp “I don’t understand!” said Prince Andrew. 
__label__twp “No, it can’t be helped, lad,” said the prince. “They’re all like that; one can’t unmarry. Don’t be afraid; I won’t tell anyone, but you know it yourself.” 
__label__twp He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his son’s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh. 
__label__twp The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity. 
__label__twp “What’s to be done? She’s pretty! I will do everything. Make your mind easy,” said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter. 
__label__twp Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son. 
__label__twp “Listen!” said he; “don’t worry about your wife: what can be done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich. * I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all right—serve him. Nicholas Bolkónski’s son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.” 
__label__twp He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his bold, tall, close handwriting. 
__label__twp “I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs; hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvórov’s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.” 
__label__twp Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet. He felt that he must not say it. 
__label__twp “I will do it all, Father,” he said. 
__label__twp “Well, now, good-by!” He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him. “Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old father...” he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: “but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkónski, I shall be ashamed!” 
__label__twp “You need not have said that to me, Father,” said the son with a smile. 
__label__twp The old man was silent. 
__label__twp “I also wanted to ask you,” continued Prince Andrew, “if I’m killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you—as I said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.” 
__label__twp “Not let the wife have him?” said the old man, and laughed. 
__label__twp They stood silent, facing one another. The old man’s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son’s. Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince’s face. 
__label__twp “We’ve said good-by. Go!” he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice, opening his door. 
__label__twp “What is it? What?” asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice. 
__label__twp Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply. 
__label__twp “Well!” he said, turning to his wife. 
__label__twp And this “Well!” sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: “Now go through your performance.” 
__label__twp “Andrew, already!” said the little princess, turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband. 
__label__twp He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder. 
__label__twp He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair. 
__label__twp “Adieu, Mary,” said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps. 
__label__twp The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out. 
__label__twp “Gone? That’s all right!” said he; and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door. 
__label__twp BOOK TWO: 1805 
__label__twp In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov. 
__label__twp On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality and surroundings—fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distance—and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia. 
__label__twp On the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to “bow too low than not bow low enough.” So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before—presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, “awl, soap, and all,” as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the soldiers’ boots. More than half the men’s boots were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles. 
__label__twp The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.
